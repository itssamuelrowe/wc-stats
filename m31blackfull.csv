  Dear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.

False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management
",1,"

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

Inferior quality and built
",1,"

  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

Serious Issue
",1,"

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

Bad Product by Samsung

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

Faulty selfie camera, video playback lagging no money back

  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

  I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me.

  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

  1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

Best Budget phone for Avg Users

  It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.

Ok product for the price range
",1,"

  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.
",4,"

  I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

  Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Vir Yadav,"
Best in class, but with a few exceptions
",1,"

  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

Disappointing 64MP Camera!!!!

  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

Battery consumption

  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg ""Stock android"" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?

Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31
",3,"

  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.

Okay, until this happened

  I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the ""Gorilla Glass"" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, ""We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as ""gorilla vorilla"" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this.""I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this ""insider"" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.

Not worth it..
",1,"

  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

Worst SOund and Microphone

  It is not 10 days that i have got this phone. But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.

  sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.

  First of all, my first review was deleted by amazon, saying its manipulating the context and feature of product..This is a review section so i can give my honest review but amazon is deleting it thats dumb.. If u dont need reviews than block it for all. Why would u only keep only positive reviews and delete any negative points????Here is the thing- battry is not uoto mark.. It drains quickly.. And it takes more than 2.5 hrs say 3 hrs as per my personal experience.Camera is good.Battery is a nightmare if u want to keep it charging after every 2 hrs than go ahead .and last time i gave 2 stars.. But u deleted the comment so this time take the 1 star for the product.. Coz its really a peice of shirt. You know twhat i mean 😂😂😂😆

Worst smartphone experience ever!
",1,"

  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!

  As consider price point galaxy m31 is very high in price because of the performance, camera quality, processor and design wise its very dull and boring in real life and also heatup very quickly when Playing games. And one more thing in galaxy m31 also have ads like redmi, realme, oppo and vivo. Samsung simply cheat you and looting you.I must said please don't waste your money on waste galaxy m31 because at this price you have very better option available in market. Samsung also leak and stole our data as like other companies so their is no difference between Chinese company and Samsung. If you not agree with me than just read carefully user agreement, terms and user policy of Samsung.

Tall claims

  The phone looks and feels good in the hand. All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value. Tganks!

Better mobile for this price tag

  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked

Samsung make fool to their customers in the name of warranty

  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....

  II am writing this with 4 months of usage.Issue1: Getting On-Hold automatically during calls.Issue2: Call recording also autmatically ON during calls even we dont need.Issue3: Sensors are very bad, not able to recognize call is going or not.Issue4: Camera stabilization is very bad, not able to take photo of scan docs perfectly, always it used to be blurred.Issue5: Charging time is more, even though they are telling 15w charge. My old phone get charged quickly rather than this.When i tried to reach customer care toll free, there is no response from them saying ""Limited staff"". Think before buying this model twice.

Performance  is slow. Don't buy (Very poor.. ghost touching problem)

  Initial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.

  Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme

  The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.

  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(

Galaxy M series phone spare part availability issue
",1,"

  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?

  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,

Keeps restarting !
",1,"

  As I waited for a really long time to buy my Samsung galaxy phone, I am pretty disappointed with the performance of this phone.The camera quality and features are fine . But the fingerprint reader asks for so many attempts.Major issue with this phone is that it keeps restarting for no reason. That too 3 to 4 times a day !Intially I thought it needs an update and might work fine after that but that didn't work too.It's not very pleasing when it restarts in the middle of some important work you trying to finish.I have been using this phone for a month now but it has not been working upto my expectations.Sorry but not happy with my purchase.

Poor experience with Amazon and Samsung m31
",5,"

  I ordered this phone and received on time. Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.

No Replace support by Amazon. Defected touchscreen
",2,"

  Most disgusting service from Amazon & Samsung ever. Received a defected Mobile which had issues with its touchscreen. Replacing the phone is such a pain in the wrong place. First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. ""Atmanirbhar"" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don't want to share your fate with Nokia.

Only attraction is quad camera!

  The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.

  Bought this phone.  Received in time.  delivery is good.  Product is very very bad.  Plan to exchange it even for china mobiles.  I bought this mobile as my friend is happily using M30 for 2yrs.  I thought M 31 will be better than M30.1.  Audio quality is very very bad -  Not able to hear even when speaker is on with max volume and all equalizer settings.  All possible solutions available on line were tried in vain.2.  Frequently hangs even for a simple task like calling!  Then we have to press the power key to switch off and switch on -  this happened 4-5 times in 10 daysI dont feel like using a new mobile.  Not worth for 20,000.  I am planning to exchange it.

  I ordered the phone on June 1, which was delivered on June 5. I tried to start the phone. It didn't. I put it in the charger. No light. Nothing. Phone was completely dead. Same day I tried to put request Amazon replace/ refund section. Now here comes the worst part. It does not allow you to refund/ replace. Rather, it asks you to talk to customer service. However, there is no one in customer service to answer your phone. I tried to call directly at Amazon 1800 number. It does not connect.

Only Indian sim card labeled phone. Don't buy if you want to use outside India.

  Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.

  I am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MIComing to negative pointsall reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.Loud speaker is not so efficient.Normal sound is goodAs its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained

  Rs 16999 for M31, It's worst product in this price segment.Camera quality is not better than vivo 21 mp, however Samsung is claiming 60 mp, which is Myth.Battery last in 1-9 hours. It takes around 3.5 hours to charge the battery fully (Samsung claim 2.5 hours)Its processor is quite slow, not getting required internet speed.I found 2 folds decrease in internet speed with this model.Touch is poor, you will find difficulty even in the slide to pick calls.Phone is getting hot even during calling and very very hot while on chargingIts buttons (power and volume) are getting pressed autonomously even without mobile coversI recommend you to never purchase such poor performance mobile phone. Please do not buy.

Samsung has joined the league of number gimmick!!
",1,"

  I will not recommend this product to anyone due to the following facts:1. Exynos 9611, which is a 10 nm processor, produces so much lagg.2. 6000 mah battery is just a gimmick. It is also not comparable with even 4000 mah battery of other brands. It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.5. Charging time is horrible. Near about 2.5 hours for full charge. It gives feel of black and white time!!I tried several times to contact Amazon technical team but they are not responding. Hopeless!!

  Overall phone hardware is great. Amazing display, good camera features, awesome battery life and sturdy to hold.  The only downside is it doesn't support 4G+ aka carrier aggregation. Owing to this,  unless you have full tower,  the voice would break and data speed would go down! The hardware supports this feature but Samsung has not activated th CA feature. Even my two year old moto had this! This is turning out a dud for me especially for indoor coverage with work from home.

Gimmicky battery. 6000mAh is just nonsense, feels like 3000mAh

  I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints hereCamera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality

A Poor Quality Phone at this Price
",1,"

  A very disappointing buy.I've been using this phone for about 3 days, which is enough to know how the phone performs, and this phone is sub-standard. Let me list the reasons why:1. To begin with the finger print scanner response is very slow. Very often it doesn't recognize the finger.2. With a big battery I was expecting it to.last a day. But with playing light games like Temple Run and Words wirh Friends the battery runs down very quickly. It also takes a little over 3 hours to charge fully.3. Camera performance is pathetic. The 64mp pics look like it's been shot with 8mph lens. And don't even try a pic at night, you won't be able to see anything with clarity.4. The phone feels heavy and cumbersome though it's hardly a few gms heavier than my previous phone.5. The volume buttons are stiff and don't respond to a normal touch.6. The swipe hand gesture to take a screenshot is useless as very often the screen moves along with the hand gesture of you're taking a screenshot on a webpage or Instagram or any other social media app.And though I have more to say, I think this is enough to dissuade you from buying this phone. I'd suggest you go for either the Realme 6 or the Note 9 Pro at the same price.

The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.For Gamers there a Game Booster App.The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.Cons:The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.

M31 has issue with Proximity sensor, Do not buy it.
",3,"

  It has issue with proximity sensor. While calling screen keep on and off and you will face issue of call on hold, call recording, over heating, battery drainage etc.It is worst fon in my life.if you can use ear phone while call, then only you should buy it.When you keep your phone on ear while calling, screen should get off so that there should not be any accidental touch . But while talking most of the time screen turns back on... SO then your ear will touch the screen and the postion of menu and then call hold or recording option clicked.I checked with service center and also share video but they could not fix it. I submitted my phone to service center 2 times but issue is still there. They are saying it is due to location of proximity sensor in this model.Now I have no option.

Not a great phone

  Having used the best Galaxy devices till date, thought of checking this out too. Clearly a slow to respond, with glitches inapp and feels much inferior in quality than my C9 Pro which i used until recently. Those on a budget, can definitely try though... waiting for the S20...

Mixed feelings
",3,"

  I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.These are my observations after single day use.1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use ""Secure Folder"". Need to install ""S Secure"" app for app lock.4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.6. OS is so smooth.7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.Update: after multiple days of regular use1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement4. Call quality isn't that great5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.

A big NOO for Samsung M Series!!! Waste of money and time! 😑
",1,"

  Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...I wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.When we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!We had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑It’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!

So have another phone ready with you as you will need it.My honest advice dont buy this phone.

Disappointed with performance. 8GB RAM feels like 2GB and lot of bloat ware
",3,"

  Too much bloat ware (useless and forced apps by Samsung)  is shipped along with the phone, if you are not expert at playing with the settings it would be tough to remove it’s forced live screen wallpapers and disable other blot ware.Video recording from front camera will be flipped, there is a toggle switch to record without flipped but it doesn’t work always. 8GB RAM etc are I think just for the specs, it just feels like a  2GB phone when using it.I bought this phone to do away with Chinese brands but disappointed finally.Chinese brands do perform a lot better for the same price range. It could be because they use Qualcomm SoCs (System on Chip). Samsung uses its own SoC for most of its entry level and economical phones.

  Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.

Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone.

  Phone has a .massive battery as stated by Samsung 6000mah capacity.  But trust me it's useless. Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing.  Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc.  Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy.

Charging the massive battery is a big problem
",1,"

  The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.

  White is not white. Screen is too warm in color. Video of human face has red tint. Selfie is totally horrible, it is beautifying fully and make clean face removing all the details. Signal quality is poor. Rs 8000/- phone redmi was connecting to internet without any issues and this phone was not. Also it was observed that voice will be heard after 5 seconds of call getting connected. This happens quite some times. Sound output is less both in speaker mode and in earpiece mode. I didn't expect so many issues with such reputed brand. Pl visit reviews with my above comments in google or GSM arena.com, many have brought out same points. But battery life is too good. Colors are punchy and vibrant but not natural  they are like over saturated.

  I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.Everything else is fine.Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.

Made in India and great specs for a reasonable price.
",2,"

  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!

A small but important technical glitch!

  The phone is generally OK. Good Camera..Long battery Charge.Incoming SMS blocking is one of the important provisions in any smart  phone.But in M31, this is partially missing.SMS coming with a phone number only can be blocked. SMS coming without a phone number and coming with names of the business group can not be blocked. This is a great shortfall.Informed to the Help center through WhatsApp chat. They assured that this shortfall will be corrected in their next update. Till the next update we have to live with the disturbance of unwanted SMSs.

  Well 5 stars to Amazon delivery and service team.The phone I received had some issues with voice quality. It had a weird vibration and echo that use to come while talking. And calls did go blank in between. Not a network issue as I tried using multiple sim.They scheduled a replacement after a technician visit. Same issue persisted. So may be its defect in the make.Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too. The second one had issues of heating up and battery hardly lasted for 12 hoursWell here it took longer for the refund but have to give starsto the support team at Amazon who kept up the follow up till we got a resolution. Really happy with both the customer service agents who helped in the process.

Not that great, false claim about fast charging!
",1,"

  Camera is good, call quality is good but the other person's voice can be heard outside even though the volume is low, when you are on call, which is a flaw in samsung phones.Speaker quality when you are speaking from a distance, in WhatsApp video calls is not good. I tried this with MI and they are much better.The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge. I had Motorola G5 Plus which charged 60-65% in one hour, which means full charge in 1.5 hours.

After 30 days situation worsened. So it landed to service centre. Another story can be written on  experience with Samsung service centre. ( to mention one thing --Not single employee wears mask at service centre .. seems all are superhuman) .So  after using hardly for 30 days  it's gone to service centre and found issue with charging port. Brand new equipment with charging port issue??? What's next awaiting God knows.Now can't return it, as return period is only 10 days after purchase. So stuck with this now.Think well before investing hard earned money in this.Dikhave pe mat jaao ....

Mobile features are good but I this seller has problem
",3,"

   I have ordered 3 mobiles from this seller.1) Samsung Galaxy M312) Samsung Galaxy M21 (4GB 64gb)3) Samsung Galaxy M21 (6GB 128gb)In first order I received the mobile, which I feel was refurbished item. I placed replacement order and I got replacement.After receiving replacement, I ordered M21 (4GB 64gb) and accordingly I received the mobile. But now both the mobiles are showing one problem and i.e. apps are flickering (i mean apps mobile screen become black and while suddenly while running apps)This problem arose for M31 after replacement period ended. I had to place replacement order for M21. But it is on the way. Few days before I had ordered another mobile to gift someone. Order is delivered today but I am worried about.I this seller has problem. Because I have regular customer for samsung mobiles and first time I am facing so many problems with Samsung mobile.

  You will get handset, charger , usb cable, and ejector pin in the pack.Fingerprinted reader fast.Battery life good.Screen color good.Camera good. You need to select 64mp to use camera in 64mp mode by default it set to lower resolution.Top side of Phone getting too much heated while in video call , or while using camera video recording.I called amazon support , they asked to do factory reset but no change.Playing YouTube video at 480p phone temp reaaches 42 degree.Wifi very weak, not receiving signal from my v380 CCTV.

Not satisfactory
",1,"

  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one week I find it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ears though automatic setting is off. Samsung should really work with this issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.

Dear Samsung - you owe us better than this

  Disappointing. Can't get worst than this. Firstly received a faulty phone which never got switched on. I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and ""so called"" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I'm not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn't work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today's generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I'm sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like ""something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D"". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you. We deserve better, you owe us better.

Not so good, not so bad☺
",5,"

  I was one of those guys who ordered this 6/128 gb phone on day one. One of the bad phones Samsung ever made. Even after few software updates, it still restarts on its own, mostly while into a browser and sometimes in other apps. Sometimes, instead of restarting, it turns into a SAMSUNG brick, ie phone will not boot and only Samsung logo keeps on displaying for long. In this condition, you can not restart the phone with power button, you have to use RESET method.  Fortunately, in this case, it only restarts and doesn't get hard reset. Battery lasts for only 4 hours of video, otherwise it's pretty good and lasts for 14-16 hours easily with normal use. Voice from earpiece had started getting deteriorate and I found that the earpiece mesh collects lot of dirt because it sits in a groove, thus vitiating voice quality. It's not waterproof (not claimed too) so if you splash water onto it expect touch to not respond and speaker volume to be extremely low for an hour or two. Though it worked perfectly after three hours of drying after I dropped it once in the water and it got submerged fully for a second or two. Samsung Swipe keyboard is little weird, many times typing wrong words. I can't say more about camera as I don't use it much. Single speaker is not bad for listening music. Fingerprint scanner is not so good, most of the time doesn't recognize. Face recognition is better than that. Still, except for the bricking part, it's a good phone for its look, screen/ resolution and hardware for this price.

I thought they will replace my phone but I was given a SERVICE REFUND COUPON of ₹17499 which can be redeemed only at a Samsung Store (Not Online). But they catch is no samsung store has samsung m31 or m31s. I don't like the A series phones. Don't know what will I do with this useless coupon.

Phone hanging frequently and Internet closing abruptly
",3,"

  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.

No fast charging  available  with this phone.2. Camera quality is not up to mark  as per 64 mp . Selfie  camera is good. File size for single file is showing 25 mb but quality  of picture is not good.3. Face lock sensor  is also  not working  properly.  Some time it works or some time you have to use finger lock.4.

quality of phone

  This phone is not as good as we expected. I bought it on 18 March 2020. So I am using it for more than 4 months. I was super excited while I saw the features like battery, camera, screen size all in my budget. But from past 1 month, I am facing an issue. Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black. If within 4 months I am facing this issue then I don't expect that it will work even for a year. Completely disappointed with Samsung. I won't go for Samsung in future.

  Two times touch screen fully stuck up. I press volume button and switch off button 7 second for rebute as Samsung site instructions ,then only touch screen worked. I want to return the mobile. when I clicked on replace option in Amazon, there is no option to return. Then I called Amazon . Amazon fixed technician visit. August17 th delivered, 19 th fixed visit, I was waiting 19 th in my home. But a rescheduled technician visit after 20 days. So called Amazon , told about too late schedule, and informed mobile camera showing very dim pictures and videos are same condition and youtube videos are same condition.Again they fixed techinican visit 21 st. I was waiting 21 st in home. But again rescheduled message is came for September 09 , I called Amazon , Amazon offered replacement. New mobiles delivered 24th. Delevery boy told to check mobile. He was waiting 10 minutes to check mobiles. 64 mp camera performance as  32 mp camera in night. Day times its 64 mp camera performance better than mi 48 mp camera. 64 mp camera can use in 3:4 ratio only . A major drawback is 64 mp camera have no zoom facilitie.0therthan 64 mp camera In photo mode there have a 4 optios as 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full. All have zoom facilitie .  Macro camera is working. Mobiles thickness is too heavy so feel size and weight too heavy. Normally I did not need finger print. So I didn't use it. After some days only I can told about battery performance.

Think twice
",1,"

  Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.

  The overall Phone design and handling is okay but lacks quality both in the the material used and the software performance. I've been using this phone for over 2 months now and all I can say is that I shouldn't have taken the negative reviews lightly. The phone lags even with minimal activity. The fingerprint sensor is almost insensitive and reminds me of old samsung phone touch screens. The camera quality is amazing but only after you adjust the settings to different(highest) resolution. Battery life is subpar and way lower than what I thought a battery this size would perform but the fast charger takes care of that problem to some extent . The inbuilt operating system lacks any applock which has to be installed from play store. The phone is okay for someone who doesn't use or expect much from his/her phone except basic functionality but I'd recommend going for a different phone if you're a heavy user or for gaming.

Camera quality is optimum.But this phone has big problem for signal strength.This phone shows fake signal that means no incoming and outgoings call is possible many times but signal shows.I compare this phone for signal strength by red mi note8 pro and vivo brand phone,Samsung M31 catches low signal strength (that means I do not use internet as good as we do use good internet speed in other phone brand such as redmi note,vivo brand phone.)This is mazor problem in samsung M31phone.

Ghost touch problem after a day of use
",5,"

  Bad experience of a Samsung product even after years...Hate the processor (Exynos 9611) as it doesn’t support quick performance or fast charging.Just after a day of use got ghost screen touches problem and was hard to force restart...got solved automatically but lost my confidence.Better processor, fast charging, glass build quality would have been better for the price.

Manufacturing defect

  cant write a review for the product quality, the ph i got just a few hours ago, already with manufacturing defect! This is the first time im having such experience with samsung! So disappointing. The ph is looking good at its first appearance but  left side of the phone is swolen and detached, having gap with the inner part of the phone! Im uploading few pictures for the sake of the review readers who are willing to buy online gadgets.But as for electronic gadgets im v much satiesfied with samsung, previous experiences are so good. Hope to get a fresh piece from the authority. Will give a feedback then.

Dont Buy
",1,"

  I bought this phone about a month back and it has a super annoying thing. The phone auto restarts whenever it thinks to do so. Its not a hardware issue as such, its by design. Try googling this issue for M31 and many other users are frustrated. Best part is there is no solution to it. Next problem is its too slow, it doesnt matter if it has 8 GB ram and 4.5 GB shows as free, if you just try to scroll a whatsapp chat window, or simply type a text message, first word starts to appear on the screen after you have typed entire sentence. A usual ""suggestion"" given by ppl is free up RAM and storage or disable  ""auto-restart"" in device care (which is not even enabled). My phone is almost new and i dont play games or do heavy multi tasking. Ram is never 50% utilized and storage is hardly 30 GB used out of 128 GB and yet you cannot even type a text message nicely.On the positive side, camera and battery are as expected. However, trust me, you'll get frustrated by its lag and restart feature.Verdict :- Its a trash.

Not a great phone but good one

  sAMOLED screen is the biggest plus point.Battery is huge but the charger is bit slow, 18 watt charger takes a lot of time to get it charged. 30 watt charger would have done the job.Speakers are loud but only primary speaker works not good for dolby atmos experience.Camera is good not the best.face recognition is just pathetic.finger print reader is not that fast.processor is average not as powerful as latest snapdragon processors.

Poor packaging of a brilliant product.
",3,"

  Well I wasn't too sure when others mentioned seeing dust around the packaged product but to my surprise I had similar experience. The phone had dust particle all around it. On top of that the package did not have even sim card ejector. I am deeply disappointed for that fact that I had to give it 1 star just because of its poor packaging and not so good first experience. In fact its sim card tray is so fragile that I am really afraid to push it even with moderate force.Cannot say much about the product quality as I am yet to experience it.

Good Phone in its Price Range
",1,"

  This is after a couple of weeks of usage.Overall, I like the device. Few things that needs improvement.1. The screen: Due to lockdown, I haven't been able to get a tempered glass. But that is no excuse for seeing the scratches on the screen. The phone hasn't fallen even once since I got it, but I see several scrathes on the screen. How poor is the glass quality?2. The fingerprint sensor is a dud. Only after repeated attempts does the phone unlock. Maybe work on it before manufacturing the newer stock.It is a great phone in it's price range but just because you are decreasing the price, doesn't mean you can compromise on the quality. Because if it does, there is no point marketing cheaper models if they are substandard.

Fake Samsung Phone Delivered

  Hi,I would like to bring this to your notice that I had Purchased Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) Sm-M315FZKGINS worth  Rs.15,999.00 on 5th of March 2020 from Amazon Prime Account which was Sold by STPL Exclusive Online and got was delivered on 7th March 2020.The Samsung M31 seems to be fake product, its not even a month the phone has stopped working completely. It keeps hanging frequently. While operating any application on phone, it stops responding along with this is issue the speaker quality has become very low (basically it does not functions) No Sound at all. Even while playing random videos on YouTube application as well in the phone's gallery it automatically gets fast forwarded without giving any command.Its altogether a very disappointing experience not only with the Samsung Phone Brand but also with Amazon Prime Membership Account and the online Retailer (STPL Exclusive Online) listed on Amazon.I would request to please get the Product replaced Asap, as Due to lock-down I am unable to even take it to Samsung Service Center or to any Mobile Repairing Shop.Note: Kindly Respond to the above complaint, or legal action will be taken further at your Cost.

Samsung M 31 worth 7K only . Worst 1MP camera.

  I Bought this phone on June 14 th after opening the box I got disappointed. The first pic I took in the front camera is the worst camera pic I have ever seen .There is no pixel or clarity it looks like 1 MP camera. After that I took a pic from back camera the picture looks as if it is taken from some basic phone .I got this phone for 18 k within 5 hours I sold it to my frnd for 14 K who recommended this phone for me. Already I'm using asus mobile for 9 K the camera is much much better than M31.Secondly I went into the youtube and opened a 4K video and went into the setting to change the resolution to 1080 pixel video but it was an sock to me the maximum resolution value is 480 pixel only.You can play the video in 480 pxl only.Tats y they did not release the mobile in the showroom.

Sounds good on paper but not up to the mark.
",1,"

  I was thinking that this product would deliver but unfortunately, I was left with a distaste.One thing to note here is that when I received the package the mobile was already switched on. However, no further setup was initiated (and no other damage or whatsoever).Ok, coming onto my problems with the phone.- The phone is fully plastic build and feels utterly cheap. (Considering the price point, I would not expect more. So , let's pass)- Another thing is the performance. I literally feel betrayed. The phone crashes when playing low end games like among us. Sometimes it needs to be rebooted due to this. And yes, talking about the reboot, the phone automatically reboots time and again (happened 6 times in 9 days).- The charger cable and the charger. Cheap Cheap and Cheap. It feels like a 90rs cable that you pick from a chinese shop present on the roadside.- Not a big fan of the huge bottom chin (It is just personal preference.).- The battery backup is on point and the camera is ok-ish.- The screen is also on par and I like it. I also like the One-UI from samsung.- The fingerprint sensor is snappy and is blazing fast.- The side buttons for volume and power are tactile and has good click to it.- And yes, kudos for the good old headphone jack.Atleast, now I know never to get a budget samsung product ever again.

Heat issues ... Do not recommend this phone

  Cons:Heats up a lot :The phone heats up a lot along the upper body during charging and gradually the entire display gets heated up . you wont be able to make calls on the phone just after unplugging  due to excessive heat.RAM usage :Phone after factory reset with no apps running consumes whooping 3GB RAM .  So the 6GB RAM is a MYTH. You hardly get 2GB of RAM space  for your applications .Memory : Out of the 64GB of memory , the system UI and OS takes a whopping 12GB of memory space .Pros:Camera is decent  and Fingerpint access is quite smooth.Summary: Phone heating up is a huge disappointment. Not sure if the product is user safety compliant

  I brought this phone because of camera and battery. Battery is fine but i expected more from camera the details of camera is poor when you zoom the image even 4x digital and optical. Recently i broughted m30s 2 weeks ago and it has some issues so i returned it and i am telling you there is no major upgrade on rare 64mp camera mode. It's almost look like m30s 48mp photos. I watched many youtubers saying this is the best camera with this price but i think it needs importants because when i zoom in after taking a image its details are gone its look like 2mp image. But i think Samsung can fix this problem with software upgrade and overall this phone is good and also I don't know why they bother giving a macro camera , it's pathetic it's can't get too close and the details are pathetic link 0.5 mp . And if samsung fix this issue with update i will update my review.Phone model no: SM-M31F/DS

If not chinese then this.

  My previous two phones were Redmi note 3 and Redmi note 5 pro mainly because of the specs it offered and was th best option available that time. Well my heart wanted to again buy a Redmi phone again but mind did not allow that maybe anti China sentiments(not naive) and thought of using something different. Lets test try the change.They increased the price of the phone by 1000 rs during lockdown and it did hurt me but I still went ahead with the phone. I am using 8GB 128GB model. (Rs19500). It cost me 2k to 3k compared to other phones but dimag tha jo mann nai raha tha.Amazing battery. It definitely last a days use and I mean it even when you use it extensively apart from gaming. Surfing, videos, movies , you can do alot of other thing it will last 20 -28 hours and battery wont disappoint you.Security: i felt more secured using a Samsung phone than the redmi phones that i have used earlier. This is something personally what i have felt.Camera: Camera quality is good and i did not get lags while clicking pictures. Honestly I do not click much pictures so this does not really matter to me.Display and Touch: Display is fine but screen gets streched, related to resolution mainly so you may not be a able to see the score of football matched on the left corner, or youtube subtitles in the full screen mode. Touch could haven better i felt and more quick.Performance: I did find issues here and i am really disappointed with the performance even though i compensated with higher ram i do feel lag while opening apps switching between apps, handling multiple task and lag here and there. I am bit skeptic not sure how much the performance degradation will happen down the line. The performance is not seamless and not upto the mark. could have been better.Ui: i am not enjoying the samsung ui and it is complicated and it does not have basic features of spamming callers or catergorzing or app lock and takes time to search through the settings option(major lag there). The navigation is difficult. I really enjoyed miui.Sound Quality: Decent not amazing not bad..okaish it wont thrill you. Could have been better.Gaming: I am not using this phone for gaming and not sure how it work but i think it wouldnt be a great performer with high end graphic games.For me Battery and Performance, ui should be top notch.  that is my only requirement. 5 for battery, 3 for performance and 2.5 for ui.There are far better phones available then again non-chinese this is the only best option.This is will get done all you day to day activity.Maybe an I buy an iPhone next time would make me an I-diot? Lol.

Decent product. Nothing great.

  Overall the product is ok. What I did not like about the product:1) Fast charger: It is just 15W. Although when you plug-in it says ""Fast charging"" it still takes approx 3.5-4 hours to fully charge. Too slow in my opinion.2) Some of the preloaded apps from Samsung are very annoying. Specially the camera app has one very bad feature. After you record a video and want to see it, it starts playing automatically. If you want to scrool forward, backward, pause etc, there is no control. It has to open the video again using a different app and then you can control. Such an annoying thing.

  Highly regret buying this phone. 2 very major problems:1) The range on 4g network is very poor. When any other phone has full range on 4g, M31 kept just besides it has only 1 line of range. And this is not just with this handset, but a very common problem. Google this issue and you will come across hundreds on people complaining about this on Samsung's page.Well, due to this, even internet and calls don't work properly. So the phone gets reduced to a camera basically.2) The fingerprint sensor needs atleast 3-4 attempts to open. Having used Redmi which needs just a fraction of second to open, this is a nightmare. Painful.Very much regret buying this.

  In short Don't buy it.The battery life & charging time is pathetic. It takes more than 3 hours to get the battery charged full. The battery even doesn't go for 1 day, with the medium usage. I compare my previous 5000 MAH battery phone with same applications (except some system apps) which I'm using in new phone also. My previous used to run around 30 hours.I checked all the inbuild application to check my device health, It was all ok. So, I thought it my be battery issue.

Not recommended - Slow performance and slow charging

  It's been a week that I bought my new Samsung galaxy M31 and gonna give a review on my experience.ProsCamera is just too awesome but I think these days many competitor phones have good camera quality.Battery goes more than 24hrs, I use comparatively less than an insta/fb/Twitter person, but more often I keep checking messages and few videos. With full charging, it says low battery after some 30 hours, so battery life is real great.ConsBut charging takes long time. Adapter has the Fast Charging sign, but to make us fool. It take around 2 hours for full charging which I feel is really long.Processor being Exynos and 6GB Ram, I feel the performance is quite poor. Phone is slow in operation. Not satisfying.Fingerprint sensor ain't that great. Sometimes fails to detect my finger and sometimes takes time.

Battery Disappointing
",1,"

  Over all performance is good but1. the battery is very disappointing. Even though it is 6000mah hardly last for one day and the biggest disadvantage is it take 3.5 hrs to get battery charged. Can't stay without mobile for such huge time during charging2. WiFi calling drop automatically and won't connect immediately3. Cam flicker a lot for slow motion capture4. Video recording brightness won't be stable while  recording. Every 2sec brightness goes very low5.

  1.Style outdated2. Weight heavier3. Performance- good but slows down while using online payments apps like google pay or paytm even on 8GB Ram4. Camera is not 64mp at all... my old phone was much clear while scanning documents as well as taking pictures5. Fingerprint response & face detector aren't much responsive as I have to open lock 8 out of 10 times6. I don't play games so wont like quoting on that part

Poor Performance for 6gb RAM
",5,"

  Camera is good and fingerprint reader is also good. But if your expectations are smooth experience on mobile screen then this is not the right mobile. There is a lag in between touching the screen and it's processing of the sameNot sure what's the use of 6 gb RAM if the processor itself is not capable enough.But if your budget is only this much the go for this. I didn't experience redmi mobile so it's better to operate both mobiles by yourelf and take a decision.Don't buy looking at 6+128gb combination.

Worst product I purchased on Amazon
",1,"

   Worst product.Camera performance is below average.I received a defective product and when asked for replacement, they performed a smartcheck and said everything is fine.Whenever I make a video call the other person is not able to hear properly.I have checked by putting the same sim card on a different mobile and used the same app to video call(WhatsApp) which was fine. When I complained on the video quality, I was told to use super steady mode.I have attached a video  shooted in super steady in the same mobile which was like the old video cassette we use to watch during 90s.Do check that before you invest your money in this smartphone.

  I am Satisfied with almost every part , the Display Is just amazing , even camera Is good (I don't have much to Do with the Camera) so its good for Me , coming to battery I am some what not Satisfied , you won't get the feel as if you are using a 6000 Mah battery , it Drains very fast , the fingerprint Sensor is good , the functions and features are also quite great and appreciable , the phone lookS gooD , the phobe Is also fast enough ,allover the phone is a good one you get a gooD feel while using It but only part I am not Satisfied Is with the battery , So if you are thinking to buy it , you can absolutely go with It

  Device performance is average... No lag, smooth performance...having little bit heating issue...But most disadvantage is camera quality...worse camera performance I ever experienced... Snaps looks like taken from 2 mp ..there is front flash.. you can't able to use 64 mp inbuilt camera every time..ever 64 mp camera snaps quality is worth...when video stabilisation , wide angle or other camere options then 64mp shot will not work..and snaps quality become pathetic.... Today's in this range around 16000rs we will easily get a good performance mobile phone with excellent camera...This phone looks dull also... I have wasted my money  please don't waste yours..🙏🙏

The camera is a joke
",3,"

  The camera of this phone is a total joke, it doesn't feel like 64 mp at all, front camera is even worse, and the wide angle camera is the funniest of all, it looks like image has been stretched unnaturally, the rear camera will capture good picture only when there is complete light, little bit of darkness and the camera quality becomes 2 mp. i was using oppo f5 which was launched in 2017 and the camera is way way better than the m31. This phone has a good battery life, display quality is good, fingerprint is not that fast but decent, this phone is not for gamers. You should buy this only if you like watching videos, listen to songs and use normal apps. Strictly Not for photography and gaming.

Pathetic phone from Samsung... Getting hanged and not working

  I have purchased this mobile from Amazon on 3rd August 2020. After using this phone for 19 days now phone has got hanged and screen is not working. I have contacted Samsung Service Centre and they informed to visit nearest Authorized service centre. After introspection of the phone Service Centre representative told that screen needs to be changed and it will take around 10-15 days. This is pathetic from global brand like Samsung. At the service centre I noticed that there were other customers who were facing the same issue.Pathetic phone from Samsung.Don't buy this handset.

M31 is bad for applications
",3,"

  When you run apps, the screen display gets crammed, one line sits over another and not legible.Otp screens are a problem, it does not clearly come out and you cannot do a proper bank transaction through third party apps which call the merchant banking system.E.g. Uber/Zomato orders/payments call merchant banking and needs otp validation. You never can do it on M31. Otp screen goes in the background.Finally end up paying everything in cash.Worst mobile and not worth the money you spent.

Fragile phone!
",5,"

  What can I say! When the phone arrived I really loved it, it looked a little heavier than my last phone, but otherwise it was good.But then why this one star review!Few days later, the phone was accidentally dropped from a height of around 1 foot and the display broke. The phone would not turn on no matter what I would do. I decided to take it to the service center thinking that this would be covered under warranty, but they clearly said this would not be covered. The display panel would cost more than 5k and I would need to wait at least 7 days. Fine, I thought. Then I received a call letting me know that the part is not available, so they will give me a refund coupon after deducting the cost of the part thats not in stock. Okay. I got the coupon. The coupon by the way can only be redeemed at designated samsung stores and not everywhere. It is also not redeemable online. So, I went ahead and got the lesser mortal M21 deciding not to invest much in any other Samsung mobile phone. But seriously I have used Lenovo and Honor and Vivo in the past. Why would a mobile handset be so fragile in 2020! It reminds me of the time when first these kinds of smartphones were introduced and one had to be really careful. Not only that, I saw many people with M31 queuing up outside the service center. I don't think the present mega review online justifies the experience of many users.Parting questions -1. Why create such a fragile phone?2. Why no spare parts available? Does it mean there are huge complaints already?Dear Samsung, honestly I expected better.

Not best for day to day usage
",3,"

  The first android phone that I bought was from Samsung way back in 2013 and after a horrible experience with it, I stopped buying Samsung phones. Between 2013 and 2020, I must have bought atleast 10 phones. This time I had to buy a Samsung only because I had to buy a non-Chinese brand and other non-Chinese brands' mobiles  were out of stock.  Bingo!, Samsung didn't fail to disappoint me this time too. 6000 mAh battery lasts me a day with almost 15% by 8PM after a full charge in the morning. I must mention that I don't play any games and I am a basic user. Just checking messages, making calls for around an hour and around 2 hours of You Tube or other video platforms.  The last phone I used was priced at 7999 and it had around 50% battery at 8 PM. The inbuilt keyboard is one of the worst I have used.  Read a lot of praises of One UI but its not good compared to others. Many apps like First Cry, Amazon take too much time to open from the Recents tab. So many extras installed. Screen I can't say as I mostly get to watch videos at max 720p, camera is a major upgrade over my last used phone so I liked it. Fingerprint reader and face recognition are good. Call quality is Good. Speaker volume is Ok for ringing for incoming calls but not OK for watching movie unless you have vulcsn hearing or there is pin drop silence around you. I have to put my hand over the speaker grills sometimes while watching movie.  PS: No, I can't use ear phones. There's a baby at home. Have to put an ear to him too.

  When I received the phone it had all dust on it under the plastic cover. I had read a similar review on Amazon about getting dust under plastic cover.Initially I suspected the cameras of the phone and the camera panel seems to be slightly displaced. Camera quality is the worst. My friend has the same phone but he's camera is good. I suspect that the original parts of this phone that I've received are siphoned. please please don't buy this phone from Amazon. They've got the worst retailers. Regretting buying this phone. The fingerprint sensor has stopped working. In just 2 months. The original parts of this phone have been removed. Like cameras and fingerprint sensor and speakers. Can't believe this. Couldn't return the phone as I didn't use it until a month after ordering.Also the face unlock feature doesn't work properly.

  One of the worst experience with any mobile brand.. Not expected from at least Samsung.. earlier I had used Le 2, Lenovo, micromax, Infinix, realme, xiomi and currently I am using Honor and IPhone 7.. every experience was a charm but this time, it’s very disappointing..Coming to Samsung M31, purchased it a month ago.. 7 days back the mobile started behaving abnormally.. it’s touch stopped working frequently and at times, the mobile started operating and clicking on different parts of the screen on its own..I went to Samsung service Center and they told that it might be software problem and so they went for a software reinstallation.. I got the mobile after that and it started working fine, but again the next day, the same problem arised..Now they are telling that it might be the problem of the motherboard and I have to wait for few days,,This is pathetic.. Samsung this experience is like chilli .. let’s see what the Samsung guys do in the next coming days..

  Good delivery service. Packaging  was good and all items in the box is genuine and was in good condition.Phones prosHuge battery capacity and still light weight. Good rear and front camera. Excellent screen display. Very nice sound quality on speakerand earphones. Has lot of customization features. And most of all Ads Free.Phone consCannot log into google account on the very first time, you will spend your entire  first day with debugging like wifi internet won't work and list goes on regardless of the latest software update.Samsung factory apps cannot be deleted and have to change the settings to stop automatically install apps without consent and unnecessary notifications.Processor is slow, so things take a while to function sometimes, even if u have the 6GB ram like YouTube videos  double touch sometimes doesn't work to 10sec rewind or fast forward the video, fingerprint unlock is not competitivelly fast but can live with it and other apps where rarely touch will work on lag. Doesn't come with back case and screen protector .... and screen protector  is a must for gorilla glass 3 and back case is also required , finger marks come very easily  without it.Final verdict , when your first few min of use is spent with so much issues that u cannot do a simple google log in , your excitement is shattered into frustration, even though the rest of the time there is no issues.....Samsung please wake up!!!

Disappointed with Samsung M31 mobile as the Display got non-functional within 3 months of use.
",1,"

  I had a horrible experience after buying Samsung M31 immediately after it's launch. The screen display got non-functional just in three months of usage. My display got blacked out just in two minutes while I was watching video. Screen went completely black as if it's switched off. The mobile didn't have any physical damage and mishandling. There was not a single game installed and I used the mobile during lockdown just for calling and and watching videos. When I contacted the Samsung service center they called it's liquid damage called bleeding and it comes under physical damage and therefore I will have to bear the repairing charges of display change which is 5000 rs. I am really disappointed with the service and company policy where the consumer is exploited for non-functioning of mobile even though it happened on its own. Buying such an expensive mobile which doesn't work for few months is really not acceptable and company should take a note of that and act accordingly in favour of the consumer. Substandard products are being made and delivered to the customer and charged in the name of policy terms and conditions.

Below-Par Quality Battery?
",1,"

  Bought this few weeks back. Noticed a bulge at the rear near finger print sensor. Had a difficult time to return this since Amazon's return policy for phones is not great even if phone is faulty like this. Considering that phone as such is Ok with decent build quality, a nice screen and decent camera, I would assume Samsung would have cut cost by relying on some cheaper (read bad quality) parts and probably that could be the reason for this. I also find similar complaints on internet of battery bulging for M31 models. Another let down was the screen size. That's not samsung's fault though. All manufacturers claims 6.5 inch screens now. But a phone with 6.2 inch with an aspect ratio of 16:9 is much larger than a phone with 6.5 inch with say, an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Basically, all manufacturers are marketing with 6.5 inch screens whereas in reality these are in effect a near 5.7 inch size. So, if we need big phone, please watch out for aspect ratio, and specifically display/phone width, apart from screen size.  (That anyways is not Samsung's fault)

  Amazon made delivery early than expected.Phone has great screen, no ads experience, in hand feel. Decent cameras, fingerprint speed and access.Most pathetic thing about phone is battery life as well as charging speed. With normal usage it at max sustains 10hrs only including few hours of standby there. It takes 2.30hrs for full charge which is very frustrating. On nail on wounds is its charging cable roughly handful of length (approx hardly 50cms). So frustrating you can't even use phone sitting on sofa while charging.

Cheating by Samsung/seller/amazon
",1,"

  I bought mobile from amazon for my wife. She was was using it last one month. I was busy with my work and for some days out of station. Today my wife told that mobile is hanging frequently. I visited samsung service centre and they told that this is problem due to water. When i told that it never fell in water nor any water drops on it. They told this may be due tosweat or moisturiser. They are not accepting warranty period. My question is if no water, how this happened. If any water, why no single font of paper label attached inside and outside, affected. No changes in paper quality and even in font style, colour,etc. If really wet why is charging properly. Why no affect in charger, charging point, earphone connecting port and no symptoms in charging port outside. How water/sweat/moisturizer came inside without affecting anything. I think either samusung used defective parts in my mobile or seller replaced it. If not seller fault, why samsung is designing such design for mobile where sweat or moistrizer may come inside and they dont write in warning/notice section. Is their design such worst and keeping space in mobile so that water may come inside without affecting other things. If really this problem, this is also manufacturing defect. I file complaint with customer care but no positive response. I am thinking to file complaint in consumer forum making party Samsung India, Amazon, Seller and their service centre. Please dont buy this phone with this seller until surity with  Samsung, seller or Amazon for further service. God know who's fault but 18000 rs loss for me. I am using samsung for many years but i faced such type of problem twice. Now i decided if they will not repair my phone, i will not buy any samsung product in my whole life....

Good for the price, but not for the specifications

  Battery life and RAM performance is very good, but the USP - 64MP main camera and other 3 cameras do not perform to the specifications. No portrait mode so no 3D photos on FB. Even the 64MP main camera fails to capture details and objects blur on zooming in - not at all expected. Macro camera does some good work, but not able to capture details required for a macro photo. Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive. Overall, average camera gives average rating for the otherwise good phone.

Display, Camera & Performance

  After purchasing this device I'm writing my opinion for Samsung Galaxy m31. Screen resolution absolutely stunning at first sight you will fall in love with it. About system presentation Samsung have really worked great on it to make it much better compared to its previous devices available in the market.Camera performance is some what not as per the expectations compared to the other devices with 64 mega pix.camera available in the market. Performance of the camera in low light is not that much good.Last but not the least regarding performance guys I'm still thinking after creating such a beautiful device why samsung have kept 1 lacuna i.e. processor chip set. Other brands are providing Snapdragon chip set which is much more powerful at this price segments while Samsung is lacking that which is some what found disappointing w.r.t. the performance. My recommended for samsung is to have Snapdragon chip set so that it will make a complete device.So guys if performance does not matters for you Just go for this device this is absolute beauti from a Samsung.

  After one month of using samsung M31. I have a lots of experiences.Advantages:1. Camera quality is great in day light.2. Touch sensitivity is excellent.3. User interface is upto the mark.4. Sound quality is average and using earphone/headphone it is excellent.5. Charging time is fast with 6000mAh.Disadvangtages1. The most important thing as we know samsung battery backup is never satisfying any user compared to other brand. It does not last a day even if the screen is not continuous light. 2.8 out of 5.2. Exynos 9811 (10 nm), the processor is not upto mark as it consumed huge battery which is unexpected. Also, it somtimes delay/hang phone.3. One major disadvantage is the signal strength. It is not getting a proper signal while other brand are using full speed on the same place.4. Camera is hopeless at low light.Note: The battery and the signal strength really needs to improved and I hope the battery backup improve with system update.

  Giving review after Using it for two days.  Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.Pros-1. Superrrrr Battery-  Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.Average features-1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.2. Camera-  Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.Cons-1. No cover provided within the box.2. No headphones provided.3. No Samsung secure folder.4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all.  It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. 👍

Also, the mobile data doesn't work after some time. We need to switch off the SIM and then ON it for further usage. I am really disappointed with Samsung. Now there is no option of returning the phone and all my money is now wasted.

  I am giving this review after 2 months of usage  so that its helpful to other customers.The phone's display (screen) is too brittle. My phone's display screen got damaged on it's own without any damage to the screen or body of the phone. It started with a small pink patch at the bottom and then started spreading day by day. Went to service center but they said it's not covered in the warranty and demanded Rs. 5000 to change the display.The battery life is also not good as per the MAH which is 6000. It hardly lasts for 1 day. The charging time is also very long. I had Mi Max 2 earlier whose battery was 5300 MAH and that lasted for more than 1.5 days with the same usage. So battery life is not as marketed.The camera quality is very good given the price range.The fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't work.

The Exynos used to be better than the SD till 810/815 - but the mid level snapdragon rangers (720/730g) are leagues above the Exynos 96xx.The performance of the phone is laggy. The battery despite being humongous 6000mAH, doesn't really last as long as you'd expect in comparison to a 5020mAH of Redmi note 9 Pro/max. The fast charging in relative terms is really slow (2-2.5 hours 5% to 100%).The Camera is decent, the UI is good, the build quality is good. But what really disappoints you is the non-snappiness of the phone. If you compare the poco x2/RN9Pro max and M31 side by side - the phone feels like a low tier middle ranger or one running on a dated mediaTek processor! The overall experience - really hits the rockbottom when after a game, phone takes a 2-3 second pause to repopulate the screen icons.Samsung, please give the Indian market the choice to select between the two processors for your phones.

  I got it in  June 2020. Due to my family member death I couldn't make a replacement or return. From the day I purchased, it's getting stuck, changed, even i end the call it doesn't end, whenever I need to speak I need to keep it on speaker else I will not be able to hear and not audible. Kindly the management pls have a look into this. I am trying to chat online with customer care and I get a message saying we work from 8am to 10pm. Even 2pm or 3pm i get the same message. If the management is having a look at my message, request the management to kindly replace. Thanks!

Defective piece delivered by Amazon

  I have purchased this phone in the month of Aug'20 and within 1 month of usage, its display has stopped working. I am unable to find any channel in Amazon by which I could register my complaint. Further while going to Samsung dealers in Jaipur i am getting all sort of excuses like the phone has defects and it is not covered under warranty as the damage seems of physical type. The other dealer is stating that the phone is defected and there is moisture in the phone.I am unable to understand that since I am using this phone there is no such damage that has happened and hence the problem exists as a manufacturing defect. Further, what is the kind of customer resolution been provided by Amazon for the person purchasing products through them as there is no provision of giving any complaint. Also Samsung needs to check the quality of products that they are offering and the service that is being provided by the dealers.I request for a response and action that may help in resolving my concerns.

Heating problem and touch screen problem

  It is very disappointing that phone has heating issue. On simple use you will feel the heat and once you have played any game then it is like old iron. It is heat the upper part of phone i.e. camera side.On the other hand screen stuck while using whatapps. Screen touch start working abnormal. I have brought  2 handsets i feel similar  issues in both of the handsets.I am not a tech bug but second phone user has raised concern  to amazon they have ask to install diagnostic  software  after that i have no idea what they have done to his handset.

  The Samsung pH M31 has its share of pros and cons. I am writing this review aft using the ph for 2 weeks.Pros - no doubt good battery life one full charge and u can easily be on a zoom video call for like 6 hrs and der would still be decent amt of charge left. The camera is decent. Sound output is decent. Call quality is good. pH is also sturdy.Cons - thanks to the 6000mah battery, the phone feels damn heavy in comparison to my old 1+ 5 ph. You might get fed up of the weight. The charger says fast charge but once the battery is down to 15 or 19 percent, to get the ph fully charged you will need atleast 2.5 hrs to 3 hrs. Can you seriously spare so much time for that. Samsung could have provided with a higher amps charger. You won't be getting any ear phones in the box, so you will have to invest on a ear phone again or use your old one. At times there is a lag of a sec or so while using the ph.I am thinking of changing this ph asap mainly because of the weight.

Poor quality product and poor warranty policy
",2,"

  I have received this product on 1st July 2020. From 10 August one spot on the screen seen which spread to the entire window within 3-4 days. This product is under warranty, but still service center is changing 5000/- to change display. No physical damage is on the body of the phone, then also they are talking that it is due to high pressure on the phone. I am not getting the reason behind this irresponsible behaviour of a company like samsung. Please never purchase a product of this company

  Fingerprint reader and camera quality is well but about it's battery life not satisfy, while this mobile had 6000 mah massive battery but it seems or may be like equal to other 4500 mah batteries. I don't think so it lasts long. Also it takes much time to connect with wi fi and flight mode is much slowly works. This device don't have split screen mode, internet speedometer. Torch is too dull. And also I thought that it's speaker may be duplicate. This mobile phone is much good but not so satisfying.

  The phone's not all bad, but yeah i expected a metal body. The phone overall look good, but the plastic used at the backside look cheap and doesnt fit properly around finger scanner. The camera is hyped, its actually not that great, more no. of cameras doesnt make a better picture for sure. I laughed way too hard when i zoomed my pictures, they dont blur they just convert into photoshopped beautified pictures. The depth in the pic is definitely missing, so ya not a great cam. No headphones, i mean this is just becoming a trend lately, but not acceptable. Also, what has happened to the usb cable length, i wonder how much does Samsung save on that. Simply Disappointed.I wish i could return the phone

Audibility Issue disappointing in this price
",2,"

  Not at all satisfied with the overall quality.Got in on 22.8.2020 for my mother.Todey is 26.8.2020 already asked for replacement.The main primary function of any phone is to communicate through call but it fails performe in that segment.In a long telephonic conversation my mother faced audibility issues after talking 15 to 20 minutes.The person on the other side was complaining that my mother's voice is fluctuating as if she was taking her mouth away from the phone.She faced same issue many a times in last 4days.I believe the position of the speaker is the main cause of it.One more thing is the quality of flash light and tourch is really poor.The set is getting heated quickly but that's expected due to a large battery inside a thin body.Processer is satisfied.As a whole disappointed as don't know if at all the audibility issue will resolve the replaced handset or not.

Worth throwing in DUSTBIN
",1,"

  Do not buy this phone as I had also bought Samsung M30s a year back and here is my experience:The phone has suddenly stopped working within warranty. The phone didnt drop, no short-circuit, no water leak etc. I go to service center and they say motherboard is damaged. Also, it is not under warranty and it will cost 9000 Rs to fix the motherboard while the official website of Samsung says it is 6800 Rs. I said what to do now as i dont want to spend 9000 rs on a 14-15K phone, so they say you can throw the phone in e-waste bin.DO NOT buy samsung as it is a fraud company with flimsy hardware that stops working for no reason. I was not doing any gaming/hardware intensive applications still the phone used to lag. Battery drains within a day without any use after few months and does not fit 6000 MAh as claimed by the company.I think the service employee was right, all its worth is being thrown in the DUSTBIN.

I showed that other  phones  from other  brands have better call  volume  but they informed we can not compare this phone with other  brands. Finally i came out of samsung service center  totally disappointed. Now i wonder  why i invested so much money  for this samsung brand. I shall  never go  for any  samsung phone in future.

  Really Disappointed by Amazon Service... I am Feeling like Cheated,I ordered the Product on 7th Sep 2020, It was Delivered by 10th Sep 2020As soon I received the Phone delivery, within couple of hours I had recognized that there is some problem with Phone Camera...Thu, Sep 10 2020, 7:41 PM (Delivery Day) : I had registered my complain on my Amazon Account, also tried to Connect with Customer service on Call,  The guy advised me the Factory Reset Option, I followed his instruction but it didn’t workedFri, Sep 11 2020, 2:30 PM : Next Day I again called the Customer Service, she instructed me to install some service app on the ordered mobile, Since I was not carrying the new mobile with me so I tried to call next daySat, Sep 12 2020, 9:40 AM  : I Called the amazon Service, The Guy told me that he needs to check the actual cause of problem, for this I need to install some app on my new mobile so that it can scan and find the problem, so he instructed me to install “minspect” app, this app failed to recognise the fault, then he told me to download “Blancco” app, I don’t know whether it worked or not but after few minutes he told me that he is arranging Technician visit, the Technician will come and inspect the Phone, Available Tech visit Slot was on 15 th Sep 2020 after 2PM, I found myself comfortable with available Slot so the visit was Scheduled, I was supposed to get an email one day before the Tech Visit with Contact details of Technician, But I didn’t get any confirmation by Mail or over Phone…Tue, Sep 15 2020, 2:50 PM : No details, No Calls No SMS and No Tech Visit - When I called the Amazon Service He apologised for the Best Service of Amazon, He arranged the Next Visit on 17 th Sep 2020, I requested him an E-Mail Confirmation about the Scheduled Visit, but he refused to confirmed by mail (System me koi problem hai sir), and noted my registered number with a promise  that he will call me on 17 th sep 2020 by 5 PM to enquire about my complain!!! He also promised me (On Record) that If Second Tech Visit is also not happened then Product will be returned since it is the Policy of Amazon that they never go for Third Tech Visit.Today 5:26 PM (17 Sep 2020) : No Tech Visit, No Repair, No Return – Today when I called the Support, It was really surprising to know that No Tech Visit Was scheduled, She told me that since I have not received any confirmation by mail so there was no such visit was scheduled, But when I argued that Amazon Service guys had confirmed me Two Visits on Record, She told me that no such Visits found on Record… any complain will not be registered unless a Technician inspects the Phone, So I am not left with any option but to rely on Amazon Support, She Registered my Request for Next Tech Visit.Product can be returned by 18 Sep 2020, and Next Tech Visit is on 19 Sep 2020 (confirmed by Mail and by SMS)!!!….I just want the Problem with Devise has to be addressed. Amazon Service Team has ruined all my hopes, I am Still carrying the Faulty Product SAMSUNG M31 , 64 GB, 128 GB with 64 Mega Pixel Camera (Which is not Working)I had spent about Rs. 17,500/-, my energy to get connect with Service Team 5 to 6 times and Tons of Mental harassment,I don’t know for how long this review will be here, only reason to post this review is that I hope Amazon will look into the issue and will improve their Service.Guilt of being cheated by Amazon will be with me for long. I have learned a lesson…. Thanks Amazon!!!

Below Average phone. Only Screen is Good.

  Overall review for the mobile. The battery life is not much even though it is advertised as 6000 mAh , there are some other mobile with smaller batteries that are better.Gaming is an absolute no. Frame Rate drop even at lowest setting. Playing PUBG is impossible.Fingerprint reader fails sometimes, you have to cover the entire reader otherwise it won't unlock. Maybe it's more accurate but it's also more time consuming.Camera is decent for the price range.Screen quality is the best part about the mobile, clarity is good.Overall I would not recommend this phone for gamers / hardcore users but it's a good option for watching movies and light use and bit of selfie

Budget smart phone

  I have purchased the samsung gaalxy m31 with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal space. Here are the pros and cons based on my usage of the phone:Pros :1) Non chinese brand2) affordable3) great camera4) battery life is great when you use it on power saving mode5) quick delivery by amazonCons:1) fingerprint sensor is terrible. Takes atleast 3 tries to get my fingerprint detected.2) cannot secure/lock apps. There is no inbuilt security for locking apps and app notifications. You have to download a third party app to lock your applications3) does not allow me to chose a sim while turning on the mobile data. You have to go the settings and change the default sim everytime you want to use another sim.(i understand this might be a weird thing to point out, but i use both my sims for internet based on the network connectivity. Hence this is a bit annoying)4) within the first month of using the phone, i experienced the error ""UI not responding"". Although i have not encountered the same error again, but it still says something about the performance of the phone.5)not happy with the battery life while using the normal mode. If the phone's mobile data/wifi is on, the battery drains quickly.Verdict : the phone is quite nice if your work is not heavily dependant on internet. With power saving mode, the battery performance is incredible. Go ahead with it if you want a budget phone with good camera, battery life and ram performance.

An average smartphone
",1,"

  I bought this phone on 5th March.  Still working well. As it has been given a 64-megapixcel camera, it is useless to do too much expectation. Some basic features are not available in this phone like pre installed music player and no option available to change the frequency of hotspot tethering. Because of this you will not be able to connect any old version laptop etc through hotspot. Battery performance is good. If we talk about its look, then the back body is not very attractive due to the plastic material body being compared to the equivalent phone available at this time. Still seeing the price range, there is no harm in buying it.  According to me, this is an average smartphone.

overhyped over-priced product
",3,"

  I am using this mobile from last 5 months continuously and it seems that it is over priced product with not satisfactory performance. Samsung has really failed in this product. The various draw backs are as:1.  The poor network receptor of this phone makes your calls getting dropped very often with lots of noise.2.  The camera quality does not do justice with this price range. Many other phones under 12K offer far better quality of camera. (However, 4k video is good for this one from noise reduction and stability perspective)3.  The fingerprint sensor is really pathetic and it fails many times.4.  The back side has started getting de-colorised.5.  The fingerprint magnet on entire screen puts really huge amount of spots which is again a big disadvantage.Good Side: The screen size and display are ok considering the brand of Samsung and such price.

Network issues with slow or no internet and intermittent network drops2. Phone is hanging sometime specially while browsingWhen i tried to return it amazon is showing option to replace only and no return option available there and for replacement also they need 10-15 days.They are making sure that in case you don't like the phone still you have to stuck with it,I mean what kind of Policy and customer handling is this,this is not expected from Amazon atleast.Also I have called customer care service but one of the senior employee was rude and implied that phone might not have any issue.Same issues have been logged in samsung community by so many other users also.Also,in this pandemic i think amazon is deliberately giving defective or wrong products. I have been using amazon for 5 years but never faced such issues. Within 2 months i have got a defective headphone, wrong item and now this phone.It seems defective items are being cleared.I would like to know if other customers are also observing this.This is not accepted !!!Samsung Amazon.com

Every time i have to delete them Manually. And the Samsung services , its like the customers have no choice their own, they have to take it otherwise this information will be a staple on upper bar of your phone(hope you get it).  Data used information or any other information sometimes its just impossible to get rid of it from there. Annoying enough.

Honest review after 2 months of usage
",4,"

  Fingerprint reader at a weird place, if you use covers it'll be even more difficult to use.Fairly good face detection, so I use that often to unlock phone. Though difficult to detect when in dark.Super artificially enhanced and processed output from both the cameras. Would love some naturals captures that's just impossible. Not a good camera. Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.Performance is good, not best not poor either.Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device. Looking forward to get some significant improvements in upcoming products.

  The volume of the phone is so low that it make me difficult to hear the conversations. We have three mobiles Samsung  A5, Xiomi redmi note4 and redmi Y3 when compared with the old mobiles the new Samsung M31 has the least volume.  So far A5 and xiomi note4 was the best deal. I bought Samsung again after buying 2 mobiles from redmi keeping in the mind of A5 but Samsung made a blunder this time.  I want to either return or exchange with another one. Waiting for Amazon to take the product back. Even the second phone has the same problem.  It means all m31 has low hearing volume.  Samsung must do something to solve this problem.

  The screen is dead after just few days of usage. The phone has not even been taken out of the house.Even when I opened the product from the package for the first time, I found it in a completely drained battery state. Usually new phones ship with a half charged battery.So definitely the product I received is a defective or refurbished product.I have been a long time user of Samsung devices and have ordered 5-6 phones so far from Amazon. Was not expecting a bad experience like this.Now since I'm outside the return window - Amazon wouldn't do anything either.I will contact Samsung support and post updates on the experience.

Motherboard failed within 6 months - refund claimed on warranty
",3,"

  Nice phone to start with, decent quality on the camera. However, Less than 6 months down, the phone begins to restart every 3-5 minutes and on opening any app. Samsung services quoted motherboard failure and that the model is replaced by m31s now, so spares not available. They have applied for a refund on the full bill value and will provide me a coupon to redeem on the Samsung store for another phone. The sad thing is I got this at 16000 and now the m31s are pegged at 20000 so have to end up spending 4-6k more on buying another Samsung phone. At the same time, I've purchased a Redmi Note 8 Pro for my family, which is doing good and has a better camera quality. If you are in this budget, look at that option as well. Its a bit on the heavier side.

Every settings... its marvelous...Camera is good for normal user... but for pro's i would not recommend it.. though you can work it out with little change in settings and here and there... autofocus is not that good but definitely not that bad too... fingerprint gives trouble sometime but other than that it works like a charm... the only issue i had it that samsung did not provide  a light border around it... so user could feel it and pace finger correctly.. the day it arrived.. i downloaded many application from microsoft word to evernote... whatsapp to skype pubG to candy crush... more the 150 app are there currently on my device but no issue of speed while switching 1 to another.. though it gets little heat up while playing pubG but not that much... and lo lagging  so far...And above all boss 6000 mah battery... for normal user ... if you charge your phn 100% and in normal use taking phone calls.. texting chatting..listening music.. playing normal games... it last 70-75 % at the end of day... woooow...I am not an high end user... and i am well aware about price range... so for me ints 4 out of 5... but for those who need everything perfect kindly incrrase your budget till 20k i must say m31 slay every predator around it.....

A nice phone except the battery life.
",2,"

  After reading so much about the 'Monster  Battery', after using it for a month I am v disappointed. Everything is nice except the battery life between charges. For a 6000 mah battery it goes down to 53% in 13 hrs of light WhatsApp & browsing. This is even worse than my previous phone (Max Pro M1)  after using for 19 months & which had a 5000 mah. I don't play games on my phone. Looks like I may have landed a bad piece.

It stopped working after 3 months.

  After 3 months of usage, it stated with issue: phone is struck at Samsung logo. Approached the local service center: Nalgonda TS. I was asked to visit Hyderabad showroom. Charged 1500 by saying some part is gone and all my data been wiped off. I started installing WhatsApp and phone been shut down and never came back. Now went to local service center. Now they say that I have to go to Same service center where it got repaired.  It’s daunting task to stand in a line at Hyderabad service center( min it takes 3 to 4 hrs) . I have written email to Samsung customer support and received an email after 1 week by saying I have to visit same service center.Now I am in search of new non Samsung ph.I went for Samsung as it’s non China company.Finally,  I would say M31 is not a trusted product and Samsung service is worst.

  It's really very bad experience to receive a branded Samsung phone and since day 1, problem occurs and within few days of using suddenly touch is not working anymore. Just so pathetic and disheartening especially during pendemic when most customers including me cannot go out in search of customer care and customer care doesn't CARE at all simply says ""Visit customer Care since they don't hv around in such a metro city. Any solution why such a product being sold during pendemic with any customer support ????Really upset , PATHETIC !!!

  The phone is good but am facing intermittent issues with internet connectivity especially when using phone hotspot. Amazon although says 10 day return policy but it directs me to some app to check my phone or call Amazon expert whose calls have a wait time of 20 minutes.

  My review after 1 week of use :Heating issues - while charging,  on video calls, during video recording,  while doing still photography in HDR mode.Back sensors - not working properly, you have to try multiple times.Camera - 3.5/5 camera is okay but not as per claim of 64mgpxl.Wifi issue- it's not able to connect to some wifi networks however at the same time other phones are able to connect to the same wifi.Battery- with full charging it is lasting for 1 day with normal use.

Bulky Disappointment
",1,"

  So, I have been using this phone for over a month now. Switched from Motorola, since I could not get another Motorola phone because of their limited sale.The phone is bulky physically as well as feature wise. They have added a lot of useless apps and the settings has so many things that are not really needed.The battery claim of 6000 mah is false. The battery comes out to be 5300 mah(screenshot added). The charging time is easily beyond 3 hours for a full charge. The wifi calling hangs at times, and it's the phone since there are phones in the house with Wifi calling. I had purchased the phone for it's battery and wifi calling feature and both are giving a hard time.The sound of the phone is pretty good.Motorola users don't switch here. The clean OS that you get there can never happen on Samsung.

M31 Not so good value for money
",3,"

  M31 lacks in a good design and built quality. Back cover is also missing in the box, which should be provided. Charging is very slow with the 15W charger provided. Camera quality and display could also have been better in a phone which is priced at a medium range. Value for money is Okay if one gets some discounts on certain cards during sale.

Not a good purchase
",3,"

  I purchased this phone after reading all the reviews and browsing thru different brands. The phone battery isn't too much to say about, phone has been hanging too often and I am neither a gaming person but normal user. Don't trust the brands blindly becoz we get cheated in the name of big brands easily and too often.For me Redmi Note 9 Pro is a better choice than Samsung M31. I already had Redmi Note 8 Pro and its no where near to its performance and quality.

Not that good as the Samsung brand is expected to be

  Likes:1. Battery is good.2. Camera appears good, though I haven't yet observed/used it keenly.Dislikes:1. The width of the handset is less than the optimal, making typing difficult due to the jumbling of alphabet in the portrait mode.2. System heats up even during the simple applications.3. It even hangs down while using simpler applications.4. The overall software is not user friendly, making simpler things complex.5. Not at par with Redmi phones. My Redmi Note 4 was better than it in many respects.6. The seller is casual and not competent enough as the packaging was quite imperfect for the phone. The phone box was simply kept in a big cardboard box alongwith some other item, without any cushioning. The seller should be blacklisted by Amazon.Redmi Note 8 Pro is a better option. I Regret for buying it.

Auto Restart Issue
",5,"

  The phone has an auto restart issue since Day 1 and a lot of Apps keep getting closed and then you have to restart the phone to make it work. While talking to someone also, the phone auto restarts which is very irritating. Tried Whatsapp chat with samsung support team, didnt work and they suggested to go to the service centre. Service centre reloaded the software but that also didnt help. Now they are suggesting to change the mother board and keep the phone for 10-12 days. DO not expect this from a new phone from Samsung at all.  Read other reviews also where people have highlighted this concern, so its a chance that you might also get a defective product

  This Mobile is not holding 4G network even for 10 seconds though the 4G network of Airtel is best in my area. If you make a call it takes approx 3 seconds and if you end the call it takes approx 5 seconds - super slow processing. Called customer care they are saying their technical person will come after 8 to 10 days and will certify that what i am saying is right or not and then they will return/replace. I have been a regular customer of amazon and purchased many mobile from them with no complaints but this mobile really has defects and needs replacement please have some belief on your regular customer. After spending Rs. 17500.00 from my hard earned money and then waiting for 8-10 days for replacement that too not confirmed is really a MENTAL HARASSMENT AND TENSION for me from Amazon. My early experience with Amazon in respect of any complaint was very good but don't know what happened this time.

  The phone is very nice in accordance with the price.The phone battery being 6000 mah gives a very good backup.The camera is decent with few glitches here and there specially in low light conditions.The major pro of this phone is its Amoled display which gives a very pleasant experience while watching videos.The overall look of the phone is also decent, though the backside of phone could have been better.The speaker is okay but could have been louder for a good experience.Major Cons:The phone doesn't have good network reception. I got it for my wife and she have started using it, she have never been able to make a complete call. The internet never works properly, have to use wifi everytime. The same simcards work very good in my one plus 5.

Terrible network issues.
",1,"

  4G network keeps dropping every 2 mins or so on both sims. Signal shows 4G but doesn't work. Then it goes to E. On switching off and on the mobile data, 4G comes back. This becomes very irritating if you're trying to watch videos on YouTube etc. Can't browse internet seamlessly. If you're a type of user who relies on mobile data, please stay away. This phone is not for you. Unfortunately for me, I realised this problem after the return window closed on amazon. I'm stuck with this thing now. There are many complaints registered on Samsung Members. Samsung is doing nothing about it except some silly settings advices.  I'm no techie but I firmly believe it's a hardware issue.I've always been a Motorola user and it works brilliantly with the same sim (Airtel). This is my first Samsung device and I must say I'm disappointed. I'm never buying a Samsung device again. I only brought this to support the boycott Chinese products sentiments

Decent purchase for 16k
",2,"

  I bought ""Samsung Galaxy M31 4GB 64GB"" in April 2020. It is a Good pick in the price range.Having spent 5 months with this phone, I would say that the 2 major drawbacks of this phone are its battery/charging and multitasking.The charging is slow and it takes atleast 6hrs for a 5% to 100% charge. That is a lot of time but if you can put it for an overnight charge, it would run you through the day with your heaviest of the usage.Coming to multitasking, i have seen this device give latency issues while multiple app usage, it hanged twice in 5 months.At times, Fingerprint scanner also disappoints, need to press it for longer times than usual.Camera happens to be the best part of this device, check out the images attached.I would recommend this device for people looking for devices around 15k, with normal usage and who appreciate having a ""Made in India"" device.

  Display is good but main camera not good. Picture colour shows nice but, as par as 64 Megapixel is concerned, images have poor pixels. Blurred looking in depth even poor as compared to other 20 Megapixel camera mobiles pictures. Macro photography is a good feature. Every android mobile phone in early stages starting six months or 1 year, has smooth performane. Thereafter they become sluggish in performance or response. As market has to launch new one interfacing their updates. Sometimes finger print sensor doesn't respond.

  Complete waste of money.In only 46 days of purchase, the handset has stopped taking the charge. Now, the picture is getting clearer by the day, as to how Samsung is providing such higher configuration at a nominal price. Indians are being cheated openly in a broad day light.If you are going with the brand name (Samsung), then, believe me you definitely will feel cheated. Except the display, it has nothing more to cheer for. The battery (6000mAh) is much hyped, on continuous usage it drains at a much faster pace. Many a times, its screen freezes and does not allow any action. If you are scrolling the screen, while on some app, it doesn't goes that smoothly and gives an impression as if the screen is freezing for decisecond.Think twice before wasting your time and resources on Samsung products. Always better to go with some other reliable brands.

Overall experience is bitter. I really dont like the smartphone. it is all plastic body and quite compressable. I have oppo reno phone i felt it is 1000% guinine than this cheating phone.

If you are not play games or paly much videos, would have use 2 days.Camera: 64MP is for gimmick, that is not up to the mark. Take a picture and zoom it, pictures will be blur. Redmi note 8 48MP far better than this. Day light camera is avg but  low light quality too poor. Macro camera quality is good.

  I have been using this phone since last one month it's an average performing phone. Face recognition is very very poor. Processor is very very poor even not comparable with MI note 4. Many features are not as compared to MI note 4. I can't believe that with 6 GB RAM It hangs very often and suddenly restart automatically. Phone starts heating suddenly if your internet is consuming little more data. When I contacted customer care via chat they simply denied to help and person was not knowing anything about phone. They have also shut down their customer care call no. Means you will not get any type of help from Samsung. This is not the Samsung brand which I was knowing earlier.

Here, some pics are uploaded which were taken in macro mode, night mode and in daylight. Batery backup  good but charging is slow. It takes 160 to 170 min to get fully charged. Phone lags heavily while playing pubG. It's display is awesome, viewing angles are very good. Fingerprint sensor a li'll  bit slow. It hangs frequently.

high priced, looks good on paper but not extraordinary
",1,"

  In 2020 you buy a 20K smartphone with ordinary looks and so called good specs on the paper.pros: displaysound in earphone is good no issuescons: battery not as per 6000mah at all, 1 day with heavy usage and 1.5 with normal usagetouch not sensitive enough as per galaxy series eariler phones as I have been using samsung galaxy S5speaker not on the premium sideexynos not fast,  being a computer engineer can feel lags, should use better processor in this rangeearpiece heating due to charging,i think battery is there in the back of earpiece, feels hot near ear if you get a call in-between charging, earpiece also very small aperture so sound comes only if you precisely place it on the middle of ear canal.

Disappointment and manufacturing defect. Please read it before buying
",1,"

  Bought this mobile just a month ago and its display got ruined with a patch on the screen. The patch is spreading badly and will cover the whole screen in a day. I've checked this on internet this issue is very basic and comes quite often in Samsung phones. My phone is in warranty period and the service center people aren't helping me and asking for 5000 to rectify the problem with the display. I would suggest not to buy Samsung phones. I'm highly disappointed with Samsung and Amazon as I can't return it either. Don't think the phone is cheaper that's why it happened to me, the patch and the display issue has even happened in their Note series also. You can check it on internet.

Connectivity Issues
",3,"

  Not a great phone. Wifi connectivity issues. It always says Ready to connect when network quality improves. But never get connected automatically, you need to check manually and connect to the wifi. This is a major problem with this phone.  Useless and paid online reviews never touch this issue.Another issue is, it will suddenly disconnect while you are on the call, even though single strength is full, you need to reconnect the call.These are the major issues of the product.  Any entry level smart phone works better. 20k is a waste of money for this third class phone.

Finishing of the product is so not good....alignment of fitting lacks perfection. Camera holes alignment or side edge you can see poor craftsmanship.

WORST PRODUCT
",4,"

  Just bought this phone not more than a month ago, first day it did not charge in the start but later it did. Then the display went bizarre all of a sudden and nothing is accessible on a brand new phone. I have been made to run around service center who are of no help. Will never consider SAMSUNG phones ever in my life again. If there was a negative rating, I would surely give that to this phone. Worst experience and worst customer service by Samsung.

  1.Back and front both Camera quality are super in day light but in dark they disappointed also portrait mode is not available, in new generation portrait mode highly recomandable but disappointed also photo not  click by finger print sensor. Surprising how it is possible with Samsung smart phone cost of 17499/-2. Gallary function not upto the mark In other phone like vivo and realme photo in mobile segrigated by peoples in photos and easily transfer their all photos to the particular person by one click without lossing of time.3. Smart assistant not avilable, which help to know status of online order, match, scan documents,etc display on home screen on sliding.4. Developer should must be ensured to besic need of costumer in next updation and hope all issue resolve, other wise we r compail to return and refund.5.During conference call with whatsapp M31 phone got overheating and warning to disconnect whatsapp call otherwise auto disconnect whithin 20 second.6.Finger print scanner is awesome.7. Battery backup  also nice super.

Fake phone at such a price. Not worth every penny.

  Hello friends please don't buy this phone. Don't buy Samsung phones they are too expensive for their value. I have been using this phone for three weeks and the earphone jack and the sound system is done. I handled it with care and I have never dropped it. But sound comes in high frequency , even when I plug in the earphones I hear nothing. It almost cost 18000. I was using Huawei honor 9n for 2 years my old phone never failed me. I thought this phone could be better but it is a waste of money. The only thing that it is better than my old phone is the screen and memory. It has stupid software. No inbuilt screen recorder, the camera is fake and it is too slow. Amazon gave only 7 days replacement I even regret buying it from amazon since flipkart gives a longer return period. I will never buy Samsung items again and I will never use amazon.

  We are using Samson 3 gadgets at home, 2 years back we bought Samsung A50 its really good mobile, still we don’t have any problem.We bought Samsung Galaxy M31 on 21.08.2020 but we are not at all satisfied with the gadget, we complained and got replacement of the same on 01.09.2020. Again we face similar problem with the mobile.1. Mobile is getting heated while speaking within few seconds2. While charging the gadget is hot3. Its Charging slowly4. If anything happens with the gadget Amazon only responsible5. Overall to say, we are not at all satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31We are seriously upset with this.  This mobile is bought for our child online class. If anything happens to the child when we are not at home - only amazon is responsible.If possible, kindly give cash back for the same.

  Its not even 2months also and the phone what I got from here is getting switched off automatically. I was attending a webinar n it got switched off in between. Once i was paying through phonepay n it got switched off. Its not one time it has happened like this more than 7-8 times. Its not worth the money. My important works are getting interrupted because of this. During this interruption my battery charge was always more than 60-70% n sometime 90% also.

  Overall for me it is a wonderful product by Samsung based on the price. Getting all this features in this price range is just awesome👍👍I would give Pro's and Con's that I felt after my use of 15 daysPros:1) Wonderful design2) Superb battery life3) AmOled display is amazing4) Camera is also good5) Fingerprint reader as given on the back is a plus for me bcz I have seen many on screen fingerprint reader going numb.. So this is having it at the back and it's just amazing.6) Headphone jack is avaliable7) Fast charging is really fast 😉Cons:1) Phone heats up quickly while charging and when used continuously for above 30-35 mins2) The touch could have been a little more smoother i.e. Less resistive3) User Interface is quite complex, took 2-3 days to completely get aquanted with it

  The mobile I got was having performance issues(got disconnected to mobile internet within few minutes every time when during calls, even though having option can use mobile data during calls option) and Amazon helpline completely not helping the customers in return and exchange policy. And not having good camera and battery taking too much time to charge eventhough 15w charger around 4 hours, not retrieving  network from sim and network lagging issue. Overall amazon is not helping for customers just skipping the issues. Completely you will not satisfy with amazon if you have any mobile issue after delivery.

  I'm giving this one star because I cannot give it zero star. I ordered it as a rakhi gift for my brother and when we unboxed it the product screen was cracked and the camera wasnt working properly the screen was glitching, I have been calling customer service continuously since 3rd august and neither Amazon nor samsung are ready to help and provide me a replacement as a result of each passing day the glass is being cracked more. The samsung service centre people are so incompetent and rude and the Samsung and Amazon are both just putting the blame on each other and not helping me in any given way. They're asking me to pay additional 3k to change my screen and only then they will give services for camera and glitches. It is DISGUSTING behaviour and i wish I hadn't bought this phone I have half a mind to toss it away

  As just like a average samsung device, Samsung UI is so boring, basic applications like network speed indicators are has to downloaded apart, playstore doesn't open easily and doesn't install apps easily, much more time wasted in mobile setup time, Camera is not into expectations, battery is decent, but takes a lot time to charge coz its 6000 mah, it is better to provide 33w fast charger rather than 18w only. Finger print scanner is really fast n quick but you have to pick it up every time when u want to unlock it's better if was given In screen fingerprint scanner.

Issues with M31
",1,"

  First 10 days the mobile was ok but after some software upgrade, the audio quality has gone down terribly. Its hard to hear to the calls without a speaker and with speaker, its not so loud. Also the mobile gets heated up soooo fastly even for a few minutes of calls. And when I use the apps, its gets heated up very quickly. I am disappointed to take my brand new mobile which is hardly less than one month old to a repair center. I made a mistake by choosing Samsung over iPhone :(

  Camera and display are great.And remaining features are routine as other android phones ,But very poor part of this mobile is battery.I have compared with other mobiles which has 4000-5000 mah battery  the performance is almost same and it takes more than 2hrs for battery getting fully charged. So strongly i won't recommend this mobile to people who use phone for 5 or more hrs per day and especially for gamers.

  Worst product by samsung. It restarts automatically when I went to service center they told me there is problem in it's motherboard. And it's unavailable at this time so i have to submitted my new phone for 20-30 days. If still the motherboard unavailable they give me coupon for it's amount. Now I am helpless. First time ever I got a worst product by samsung. After this I will not purchase any samsung brand.

This is not a product review. This review is based on Samsung's after sales treatment.
",2,"

  The phone itself is an average mid range phone (good battery, fast charging, semi-premium look that is common in this range, average processor and a VERY AVERAGE / POOR camera) that people will prefer (over Chinese manufacturers like Oppo, Xiaomi etc.) because of the brand, namely, Samsung. And I will tell you this, once you buy the product, you are on your own. I was using the phone for a few months when without any physical damage (it has not fallen once, there are no scratches, I handled the phone with care), a purple spot appeared on the screen. Eventually, that spot spread and covered the entire screen so that nothing is visible, leaving the phone unusable. I contacted Samsung and without looking at the phone, they said this is physical damage and it is not covered in the 6 months warranty period. I got the phone at around 16k and they are asking for about 5k to repair it. So this has been my Samsung experience. I will try to take this matter to the Consumer Forum.

Big disappointment

  This phone is a total waste of money. And so is the service being given by Amazon and samsung both.I ordered this phone on 3rd July 2020 using prime and was told that the order will be delivered next day. Despite of the commitment the order was delayed and was received on 7th July, that too after multiple follow ups.The phone didn't even functioned for 1 month. It just hanged once and upon restarting it's touch stopped working. Upon complaining I was told that amazon will not be able to help me and I was supposed to contact the costumer service of samsung. The customer service told that there is some technical glitch with the phone and they have received other complaints as well but yet they were not able to hel because the defective part could l not be procured. They could not even replace the phone.This phone and the service being provided by two of the famous brands ie samsung and amazon is such a big disappointment.

  I thought Samsung changed a lot, but I can say 'not yet'. I bought Samsung M31 on Mid of March 2020 and same got complaint by September 23rd 2020. Issue is stuck and restarting with Samsung logo. Initially I was facing this issue 3 or 4 times a day, but later on Sep24th issue occurring multiple times in an hour. I have given this to service centre couple of times, they have done something with software, I think. Issue remains same.I have given phone again today in service centre, they feel everything perfect with software, something went wrong with hardware. Don't know what's going to happen. Really fed up with this bitter experience.

Just average but hyped
",1,"

  This is selling mostly because in India we don't have much non Chinese phone options. As a product m31 is just average and not reflective of the high ratings people give here.. For price to value - poco x2 or realme 6pro are better options, but don't buy Chinese phones.The good :  battery life, amoled screenThe bad : poor performance - the phone stutters after using a while, WiFi drops, erratic touch responses, half the time fingerprint sensor won't work.The ugly: form factor and design, competition is much ahead in looks, Too much hype with 64mp and 4 camera setup, does not seem durable too.

Camera quality is too poor
",1,"

  Before buying this product i saw so many reviews and everywhere it was said that the product is awesome and the camera quality is also fabulous. But the fact is that after buying this product when i took photo than in low light it looks like i took photo by a 2 MP camera. And after that i tried the macro camera but it didn't able to focus the object. And when i zoom the picture then it is going to blur and the edge detection is also not good. I clearly able to say that the 12 or 32 MP camera of other company far better than this 64 MP camera for macro shoot..After using 2 day i thought to return this other but it was not able to exchange with other product. So i am trying to adjust with this product. So i am not suggest to anyone buying this product in this price range

  Negatives : Everything is good in this phone but I expected much more camera quality in low light, more details in photos.Ive seen many cameras with same Mp with better photo quality.If you love photography then this Camera is a disappointment. By the way the processor is not ideal for Pubg lovers.There speaker of the phone is too close to hand position. Fingerprint sensor is average.Selfie camera is not the best in business.Positive: The screen is jst wow.  Battery is damn good.If it isnt for the battery I  would have returned this phone.

  Based on the reviews, bought this mobile. It was delivered on time. Also picked up the cover and tempered glass guard.  Everything was fine and one fine day (within 15 days of its purchase), the touch all of a sudden stopped working. Tried re-initializing with difficulty. But this also did not work.  Contacted Samsung and they told that it cannot be replaced but has to be serviced.  Handed the mobile to their service partners.  After a few days they came back and told they don't have the spare and hence they will give a Samsung Coupon which can be used to buy anything at their Samsung Store.  This whole episode took more than 14 days from the date of handing over the mobile to their Service Partner. I expected better service from Samsung but then looks like everyone is the same.

  This is a pathetic choice of my life I feel. I bought it a month ago and have been experiencing utter pain of choosing it over many options available. The only thing good is display rather everything is below average. It doesn't give the best of performances though it has 6000 mah but its worthless and almost like 4500 mah. 64 mps is a joke. I don't play pubg over it. Just a game of PES 2020 is what I have been playing over it on wifi and such a disgrace that this phone makes me loose many a times due to it's lag. It has made me such irritable that I chose to call quits and uninstall it. It's not a very high graphic game like pubg. The hype of this phone is too much for the taking and should be reviewed by everyone so that such smartphones with only just promises but no deliverance is stopped from being designed and launched. I charge it to the fullest in the morning around 10 and by the evening it comes down to 20-30 mostly with not so much of gaming.

  Fast charging is a joke. The phone heats up on light use. The screen is not as sensitive as my Honor 8x. The software has some small inconveniences, it won't let you stop internet for any apps, and it doesn't show the Internet speed in the status bar. The camera is excellent.

  We had purchased this mobile in the period of lockdown, but when the product got delivered we were not in the place of delivery and my parents had collected the courier, however almost after 2 months only I was able to go back to my home post that when I inserted the sim the phone wasn't working fine, even the battery back up is not great. The basic reason to purchase the mobile itself is not met as the basic featured of mobile is while speaking the other side who is speaking with us we are not able to hear, the voice is extremely febel. The single rating is the least for this product, if there was anything less than this I would have seriously opted for that rating. I need the product to be exchanged or my money need to be returned.

Don't rush to this Samsung Model.

  The phone has been doing good. The battery is alright, the camera is efficient. But just in span of 16 days of using it, the phone automatically restarted for like 4 times. Two of such times was like I had press the power key and lower volume key to switch it back on. Being a fairly good phone at this price there are certain drawbacks- this system restarting thing and the processor need to be better.Apart from that, it's a good phone with this budget.Take your time when you choose your handset, I was in a rush and needed urgently since the other option which I was considering a Moto phone wasn't deliverable at my address out of the lockdown effects.

  Finger print is rear mounted and it is placed little higher than the normal position. Hence had to put an extra effort to correctly place index finger.Eventhough M31 has 6000ma battery but it is still not comparable to realme battery of even lower model.Camera module 64mp is also not upto the mark. Pictures get blured on maximizing.My samsung note4 with 16mp takes better picture tham M31.What I always loved is samsung display and one touch ui as it is very user friendly thats what make me samsung fan.One my suggestion to samsung is also to remove the charger and usb cable because user always has a charger and usb cable from previous phone or if required can always buy charger and usb of their choice.

Samsung - BAD Warranty
",3,"

  No hard feelings for the Seller. You did a good Job and delivered on Time.Samsung on the other hand, screw you. The device broke in 10 days (touchscreen was shabby from the start, after 10 days it stopped working completely) and I have to bear the total cost of repair.Now, I have to pay 5,500 Rs. to get a new touchscreen. Reason: "".. there is a white color substance on top of USB connector so there must have been a spill so you have to pay the entire amount.""I have not dropped the phone in water or have had any spills. The white substance could be rust from pure Zinc (which connectors are not). Zinc can corrode just by humidity. Everything other than connector is just dandy. No rust, nothing.As just an ordinary customer there is nothing I can do about it. If the guy says I have to pay the money, I have to pay the money.

Network and WiFi speed inconsistent.

  After using the device for more than 20 days came across a major issue. The mobile data and WiFi speed in the device is inconsistent, even in the safe mode also. Where as the same checked in other mobile devices is perfectly fine. Called Samsung customer support for the same but they just suggested some basic network setting which were already checked. At the last I was told to uninstall all third party apps and re-install them. Problem still persists. The same problem is being faced by multiple m31 users.  Avoid until problem is resolved.

6000mah battery drains in no time.

  Hi team,I have bought the order and completing 10 days, I'm not happy with the product , the brand new 6000mah phone drains faster than my old phone which is  a 4000mah battery. The battery started to drain faster after installing more apps which was actually after 7 days.A 20k phone now needs to be serviced in our own efforts to a samsung service center during the lockdown, due to the fact that I have crossed the 7 day cross mark of return period. The Amazon team easily denied the replacement/refund option saying that I have crossed 7days.The phone has come up with so many bugs even after the software updates.I would not recommend everyone to not go with this model. The display looks dull though it's amoled type.Please go for another model n vendor at this price.

  This is just useless product from Samsung & Amazon.Total waste of money.Do not buy the phone.I ordered the Samsung M31 phone on 20.03.2020, but due to lockdown I got it on 26.05.2020.Even after so long wait I had more disappointment later on. As the just after 10 days of use my phone's sound was not working and videos play in auto fast forward mode. So, I gave the phone to Service center on 15.06.2020, got the phone repaired and delivered on 29.06.2020 but on 04.07.2020, it was showing same problem.Now again there is lockdown in our are till 12.07.2020.This is really disgusting phone from Samsung and Amazon is advertising.I just want full refund of full amount from Amazon and compensation for harassment and discomfort and hardship in difficult time and take back the useless phone..I want to give Zero Rating (which is not provided by the system)for the Samsung M31.

Does not meet superior expectations
",4,"

  For a mobile with 6GB ram n 128gb memory, the responsiveness of the mobile is not impressive.i still see Apps hanging.. and Samsung has loaded with so many unnecessary apps and just their own apps take up so much power. Secondly I went on a day out, where we took a lot of photos, but I was shocked to see 6000 mah battery drain to 20% in just 6-7 hours. My previous phone with just 3200 mah was lasting longer than this. The camera picture quality is good,but there is a lag in capturing images. The camera app could be better. Overall I m not as impressed as I would expect with a phone of such hardware specs. Samsung could definitely do better, and this lack of quality doesn't help Made in India tag.

  Should be fine for an average user. I dont think this phone can handle heavy gaming. The only game I play on this phone is coin master and I've seen that game not load or just close on its own like 5 times in the 2 weeks I've owned this phone. Camera isn't that good. Display is ok. But its the large battery that is the only reason I bought the phone, and it does last long. Light gaming, YouTube, instagram, twitter, and other daily tasks is no problem for battery life. You can easily see 9+ hours of screen on time, I've seen as high as 11+. I was glad to see there is no idle battery drain. I go to sleep with the battery at 90% and when I wake up in the morning the battery is still at 90% or sometimes 89%. Which is great.

  Hi All, so it's been 3 days that I started using this phone. First of all, I purchased it as it had a higher rating and this is the first time I am using a Samsung mobile. The mobile has a good camera and battery life but then there are cons too:1. It takes really long time to charge. Around more than 1.5 hr to get 100% charged.2. The back panel of the mobile is very very slippery, so for someone like me who want a grip to hold I feel that we should get a really stronger cell case.3. No user manual is provided with the phone nor the sim insertion pin that we get for all the phones these days. Packaging could be much better than this.And one point is that, As I am a one plus user earlier I feel this mobile is heavier and thicker compared to it. I felt lil discomfort in it. But with these three days of usage I'm okay now.

  5 months ago, I gave very good feedback about this phone. But after using for almost 5 and a half months this phone is giving a lot of trouble. As you can see in my uploaded image, this phone screen is frozen. It happened several times. The phone restarts itself several time and sometime it will be stuck for an entire day. This problem is impacting my work life. I cleared the memory, I removed and uninstalled many apps but still no result. The worst part is that I am trying to get my money back and I requested for a replacement also, but customer care is not at all helping me out for this process. I am facing this issue for the last 20 days..... this is the worst service from Samsung. I feel like cheated. Folks, please think twice before buying this phone.

But ofcourse its maybe coz its 6000mahThe camera only has big mega pixel numbers but I wouldn't say it's shows visible  difference when compared to 16 or 12 mega pixel camerasA few sudden reboots and weird behaviour such as sounds going on and off of keyboard taps has been observed.

  The product is really bad after a month of usage it started developing touch screen issues where the touch screen wouldn’t work for almost a day and then start working on its own.

Later they say phone can’t be repaired and we will give you a credit note after deducting charges of repair in tune of Inr 5000. My experience with Samsung phones has been really bad in the past as well. I wouldn’t recommend people to buy Samsung mobiles.

Useless mobile, plz dont buy
",1,"

  This is the useless mobile. I strongly recommend not to buy it. I purchased it from amazon and after two days touchscreen was not working for whole day. Suddenly touchscreen started working on next day and same issue I am facing after every 2 to 3 days. For whole day I am struggling with touchscreen. Now after 10 days I got new issue that is overheating and even phone is automatically closing the applications like whatsapp, saying there is overheating of phone. This is useless phone, I request all who are planning to get this mobile please don't order it, for sure u will be struggling with it without any support due to COVID-19. dont buy any samsung mobile, go for Lenovo, mi or one plus.. etc. Not happy with the support from amazon too.

Lots of Hanging Issue

   1. Hanging Issue,Mentioned as 64 Megapixel but quality worst than 10 megapixel.Kindly check uploaded video for reference2. Dated 25th Aug 2020 - Recieved replacement today but phone is completely dead. It was in charging and asking for reboot. Don’t understand why it’s asking for reboot. And the packing didn’t had the plastic quoted covering on Samsung company box.This makes me think fishy for recieved replacement.@Amazon, kindly look into the updated pic.

VERY BAD SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE, TOO MANY ADS
",1,"

  Software experience not at all good worst then Chinese phone, lot of ads samsung is trying to push through their phones lately, even in setting menu they are pushing ads, random apps instalation or like one click instalation ads etc , 🙁 . Had bought this phone to my mom and after a month I see around 20 to 25 random apps isntalled in it and slowing down the phone and eating up battery in the background. What's wrong with samsung making money one these ads... And even they won't allow you to disable or uninstall these app or ads suggestions. Each time you click on theose ads samsung is making money out of you 🙄🤦🤦

Average phone with average sound quality, slow charging.
",5,"

  I had Xiaomi phone before this and it was pretty much better than this. The sound quality is not that good, screen quality is average and Samsung keyboard hangs sometimes so I made google keyboard as the default keyboard. Camera is good only in 64mp mode. Charging is really slow even though it displays fast charging. Also, it automatically installs Snapchat and solitaire on every update and is not allowing to uninstall some third party apps like Netflix, facebook. I went on to Samsung from Mi just because of anti chinese sentiment, but the phone has nothing special to offer.

Manufacturing defect

  Within 10 days of its purchase, the mobile developed malfunction as it got hanged. The touchscreen stopped functioning, not even allowing me to restart. Had to stand in a queue for hours at service centre. They said it's a manufacturing defect. They check touchscreen and then the motherboard. If still, they can't solve the problem, I can get a refund.  But I have to wait for 15 days or more to know if it can be repaired or not. I have been using Samsung phones for long. Didn't expect it will have a manufacturing defect. Bad experience. Not sure if I will ever buy mobile online or of Samsung brand.

Fast charging is a funny thing that they added.
",1,"

  Amazon delivery was fast and it came a bit early. I have no issue with the delivery. But the phone seems a bit skeptical. I charged it foe half an hour and powered on the phone. Strange as it seemed, it goes directly into the boot option. I did the process again, and the result was the same. So I powered on from the boot menu. Phone got ON.Then I did the battery testing with my old phone which does not support fast charging. Surprised to say, my old phone is charging faster that the Samsung. I tried that for 4 cycles. Every time the result was the same. Displaying 'Fast Charging' while charging doesn't mean that it is charging fast. Yo, I could change my wallpaper to ""Fast Charging' and say my phone supports fast charging.

Its earphone/headphone  port is in bottom side which is difficult to use of you want to keep mobile in shirt.2. Phone gets heated when you play games.3. I did not find it more user friendly.4 if want to delete any thing like SMS it asks 3-4 times confirmation which irritate.Positives are battery, camera.

  After using 14days, there is a manufacturing defect. It happens. But the Samsung service center nearby my locality is too bad. They have taken almost 15days until the problem is not resolved.It is a request to the Amazon if they can do check the device for manufacturing defects in any authorized Samsung service center before delivering. If it is possible, then no bother about the delay of delivery due to this checking. Otherwise, Amazon should increase the duration of the replacement of items from 10 days to 30 days at least for this special case of manufacturing defects.

  The camera is not THAT good.. I mean the way they show it in the ads. But then again, at this price,  it's acceptable. The phone should have come with a cover cuz the metallic finish makes it slippery. The hardcover I ordered with it was of no use. I had exchanged my previous phone and got almost Rs. 5000 off  and I immediately regretted it as a lot of tools/in built functions do not exist in this phone. The only good thing which still is debatable is the battery I guess. I wish I had bought some other phone instead.

So we are not satisfied with this product. Even some of the useful apps are not implemented in M31 which is unforgivable.

  Mobile had  a mother board  issue. Stopped working after 2 month since purchase. No replacement for mobile. After continuous call to customer care and service center they are not providing online coupon or money transfer or same new mobile.As per company policy they will give offline coupon and said to purchase mobile from store which is available in store and above the price of offline coupon. As M series mobile is only available online , now I need to give extra money and buy mobile which I don't want.Not satisfied with service center, customer care service and company low level policy.

Superhiked phone with zero features

  This is my first Samsung android phone.. now it is proven my decision to avoid Samsung till date was right and deeply disappointed by Samsung quality...Battery is so called 6000mAH, but does not sustain 10 hours of use.. 20% battery drops with one hour of Facebook or YouTube use..Inbuilt apps are not helpful at all.At worst is Samsung doesn't support English UK, India or Marathi.

Heating up issue with mobile
",4,"

  Hi, I have raised a concern already about heating up of device. When I am on call, mobile gets heated up very much and I am facing sever pain below my left ear.After stating all this over the call (I used my old mobile to call), Amazon team has asked me to do troubleshooting and diagnosed my mobile when I was not using my mobile and  the result showed under control temperature of the device. I am shocked that even I stated so many times about my physical pain, they are not ready to place a request of return/replacement.I urge you to please support here. I am not able to see any other option to return it.Going forward, I would not be ordering anything from Amazon and will also suggest my friends and family too.

Defect model

  There is a fault in this model I observed and reported to Samsung support but there is no support from Samsung. Issue details: If you are in a video call(Whatsapp/hangouts/zoom, Duo) and if you get a normal call in the middle and if you disconnect the normal call and continue the video call, the video call voice is very low(can't hear the other end voice)after disconnecting the normal call, this is happening on all above-mentioned app's.Mentioned as 6000 mah battery but an actual performance like a 4000 mah in normal usage.I tried checking this in my other mobile, no issue found.

  the phone screen is of low quality it says it gorilla i put it on a book on a table and it slipped off to the table from the book and the screen cracked. Its hardly 15 days old really this quality of screen sucks does not seems like good product at all and regardless the cutomer service of this brand Samsung is also very bad they think customer as fool and try to play around after saying that the executive is transferring my call to his manager he just stayed silent for 20 minutes whil I could hear and sense his activity and then hung the call.. NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG ITS BETTER TO GO FOR OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT THE SAME PRICE. NONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY NONE

  Display is very poor it broken on a fall after only two weeks of use even with back cover and tampered glass and placed in a leather hand bag . And the worst is Samsung don’t a have its Accessories for M  series display to get it replaced even at our own  cost . Waiting for more than month .  And the service center still don’t know when  it can be  repaired . The insurance also is of no use. Now the service center informed we have to handover the phone to them and they will try to a display replaced if not they give a coupon for the price after reducing the service charge and accessories charge .

Glitchy phone that switches off automatically
",2,"

  The camera quality is good however the pictures come out looking slightly ""fake"". The saturation on these pictures is quite high, often leaving a slightly yellow tinge.The biggest problem with this phone however, is that the phone automatically switches off and doesn't switch back on for at least 8-10 minutes. This isn't due to an uncharged battery, or a draining battery, as the phone would be at full charge when this issue occurs. And upon the restarting of the phone, the battery power remains at the same percentage it was at when the phone switched off. I don't know of this is just a faulty device issue or if this persists across all Samsung devices.

Budget phone / m31
",1,"

  Well.The battery is neither a bull nor a horse. It is just adequate to power such a heavily loaded machine. Will power a day and half max. Mind it I don't use mobile games. Bummer!Had network drop couple times. Not sure yet if it's my tower or recipient tower issue.Am changing mobile after four years. So this m31 fitted well within budget and expectations. Got good exchange for my redmi note 4.Overall shopping and delivery was great.128 GB is a great help. Also dedicated memory card slot. Wow.Final verdict. For the 12500₹ I spent after exchange and discount for 6/128 model m31 makes me smile. Thanks.

Connects to 5Ghz wifi also.Cons :1. 6000mAh battery doesnt perform as expected. It gives exactly same battery performance as my previous redmi 5 3300mAh.2. Finger print unlock is not that quick compared to other phones.3. Mobile heats up alot below finger scanner area for these games I play pubg, cod, sky.4. Mobile freezes meanwhile texting. Keypad froze without text box on screen or on app list screen. Have to restart everytime.

  Front cam is bad. Finger print scanner and backpanel has a slight gap which gathers dust around it. Face unlock and fingerprint lock is a bit slow though. Battery works okay. If backpanel was also made of gorilla glass it would be better as it gets dusty and greasy every time u use it. phone is heavy. Back Cam doesnt look even close to 64 mp. The so called front screen broke after falling from a very small height and there is no backcover available and even repair shops dont have its spare parts

  The phone is not available in exchange list of amazon or flipkart, nor was there a return policy. that says a lot about the quality of phone.  Further the packaging was ok, but the backside of phone has a 1 inch long hairline scratch, which is clearly visible to naked eyes.  The quality of front camera is thrash. I am having so much trouble during video calls. 2 days long battery is a myth. Only lasts little longer than a day with moderate use. There is no adaptive screen brightness. Even the phone charger has stopped responding at the end of first month of use ! Worst buying experience with amazon.

  Am not wonder 60000mh battery hv been provided but fast charging option seems not working....just imagine from 23% to reach  45% it took around 45 minutes....am not sure how much exact time it will take to get full charged....ppl really hv that much time to wait to get it charged full now a days?If I comapred to my earlier oppo F11 where fast charging charger took only 55to 60mins to get full charged. In my sense picking samsung M31 is one great blunder when it comes the issues of  cost investment and remaining feature yet to see how its perfomr in the coming days in other areas.

Major issue is network problem

  The major issue in Samsung M31 is network problem, Whenever calling to someone first call always we cant hear the opposite person voice and also while speaking u cant hear opposite side voice. Even internet also not upto the mark. Battery is ok. 64MP/32MP Rear/Front camera is shown but its sensors are not good. Heating while charging, But while playing games its not producing that much heat. Video clarity is good. For this amount samsung could have use Qualcomm Snapdragon 600/700 series processor instead of Exynos.

Terrible Heating issue and bad performing front camera!
",1,"

  The front camera is really performing very bad.This phone has a serious issue of screen heating after using this phone for half an hour it is impossible to touch it to your cheeks.Even on the normal usage with just 2-3 social networking apps the phone gets terribly heat.Don't buy this phone as I have replaced it and even on the replacement i saw the same issues so I have returned the phone and got my money.Thanks for Amazon for quick refund. 😊

Pros and cons

  I am writing review after using the product for 1month.It's battery life is too good. But the should provide a powerful charger for such a huge battery.It's UI is too good much better than realme and redmi .Display quality is too goodBut the device gets heatup too soon .And even it's performance is not up to mark.Even Pubg lite lags if you play on HD+EXTREME.So don't buy it if you want to buy it for gaming.You can purchase it if you want to have some light gaming. And general uses. such as watchin videos on Netflix, Amazon prime videos, etc.

  I purchased this phone about 10 days ago and it has already started lagging.The camera is just disappointing! Definitely not ""64k""My old phone of 13k gave much better camera output.Not worth the price or hype.I am a light user and still face problems with this within 10 days..Battery is the only good part.I also experience some lag while using the phone. Sometimes the touch doesn't respond.Completely disappointed.

Worst || Mobile got an issue in 1.5 months only
",1,"

  - Purchased mobile- One fine day without network gone for both of the SIM cards- Went to service center and submitted the mobile- Got an update from service center that this mobile is non repairable- Also got an update that I will not get mobile replacement also not get my cash back. What samsung is offering me is the coupon which only can be used in samsung stores. I can not purchase mobile online nor I change the brand of the mobile.- And this whole process will take a month of time.- Worst service from Samsung, worst device... really bad experience...

Good but not great
",2,"

  Beginning with performance it is definitely not a great phone but decent. As everyone knows display is great and perfect.Battery which is the biggest asset of this phone completely disappointed me.I never felt I was using 6000mah battery.Samsung should immediately optimiz its performance with battery. More over it took me 2 1/2 hrs to fill 0 to 100%  battery.Camera is not up to matk. Since it has 64 MP camera it takes more time to bind the pixels but processor is slow so it takes more time to process image.UI is great.

Front camera not up to the mark
",1,"

  Its front camera isn't up to the mark. 16MP selfie camera of Redmi Note 7 takes better selfie than Galaxy M31's 32MP camera. Its battery charges in 4.5 hours. It lasts more than 1 day. But thinking about 6000 Mah battery it isn't good enough. My Redmi Note 7's 4000 Mah battery charges in 80 minutes and lasts full day.Charging speed and selfie camera issue needs to be sorted out in next update.Everything else is satisfactory.Update: after almost 25 days of usage I find battery amazing. It takes time for charging but battery backup is amazing. Front camera still sucks.

Night mode pictures are taking some 5-7 seconds processing time to take the next picture. For calling also it reacts very slow it takes 2 seconds after selecting the contact and after disconnecting the call. Not sure about battery as I didn't test it exactly but I doubt it also. Options are not user frendly. Overall I was totally shocked and disappointed with  samsung quality as I had so much excitement when I ordered it.

  I was an Apple user then used Mi Note 5Pro and now using Samsung M31 6GB, 128GB.I bought this phone on the very first day of its launch on Amazon. Not really impressed with the Phone. It hangs a lot. Camera quality is poor and no where near what they claim in promotional videos. All of sudden gets restart and very annoying. Must say there are much better phone available in market at same price range.

  Screen color, touch & smoothness is OK. Face unlock is for namesake. It never works properly. Lot of basic features required like call history doesn't show caller number. Pls change sign of portrait to screen rotation which is common. Add feature of most called numbers so it will save time of searching in phone directory.  It takes lot of time to charge battery 100%. Quick charge required. Bluetooth connectivity is an issue. Takes more time to start the mobile compare to other brand smartphones. Overall I will rate 3 star to this phone.

  The phone looks sleek,handy. Camera is good. However the battery seems to drain faster than expected though its 6000mAh. Navigation looks a bit tough and too many steps to get things done. Some of the features and functions look too old compared to similar phones of different make. The widgets are not helpful at all. Some of the basic apps like activity tracker which are in built in many phones these days are missing.

  The camera and battery life is pretty good,  the problem lies with the built quality and the performance. The performance is a big bummer and I am not talking about gaming, there is stutter during the opening and closing of apps, something you don't expect from a 16.5k phone, plus this phone has the worst built quality I have seen in a very long time, the back can be scratched by wind and they don't even provide a back cover.

Worst phone don't buy
",1,"

  You will face the problem in using internet on this phone even on jio and Airtel 4G networks. The Samsung care centres are the worst service provider. They will ask you to submit your phone for 10 days if it is in warranty. They only deal out of warranty phone very fast.. please don't buy this phone if you want to enjoy faster Internet

Best deal for the buck yet does the job.
",2,"

  Overall the phone is good, but seems a little laggy, experienced screen blackout for the second time in my 15day usage, camera performs fantastic offers a great tone balance but struggles indoors in super steady mode, yet great details captured by 64&32mp lenses. The super amoled panel is the might of the phone with perfect viewing angles. The battery lasts for a full 2days with heavy usage.If compared with vivo v1x pertaining to internet speed when using browser and downloading apps m31 is a lot slower in terms of downloading as compared to vivo both running on jio sim & same plans.

Samsung M31 automatically switches off & restarts

  Samsung M31 automatically restarts.. ram  processor is worst.. i have had a very bad experience of this phone.. phone slows down a bit then it hangs and which results in automatic restarting the phone.. bcoz of this i loose my data or the things I was working on.. i have been facing this bad experience since first day I received my mob.. initially i thot that some update might be coming .. but then lockdown began and I was unable to reach customer service centre. I hope Samsung will look into the matter at the earliest and provide a appropriate solution for the same..

The phone freezes after working for 4 minutes and face sensor does not work. What a waste of 17K.

  I am using M31 (6GB,128GB), the performance is good but there is some problems:1.

Gyroscope is not much Sensitive as compare to other brand phones.At last phone is good, not better choice for gamers.

Review after using 2 month

  I exchanged my oneplus 5 for this phone and this one is really good. It has a great camera and better than oneplus 5. The battery life is amazing and the main thing is the SAR value which is very low than other phones in this segment.Cons:The fingerprint sensor is very terrible. I had the oneplus and it recognises even if the finger was wet. But here it very terrible.

An average phone with nothing as said in the promotions.
",1,"

  System:System UI Stopped - my phone encounters this issue often and gets shut down in the mid of a phone call or at times of camera usage and restarts after a couple of long minutes. Moreover, the phone gets heated up too often with minimal usage of surfing (no gaming).Camera: Not as promised. Not worth a single rating as the pictures are distorted when taken at night.64MP (no zoom ) fails in comparison to a 16MP cam quality ....the picture taken are sharp and blurred when zoomed.The only good thing is fast charging and battery life. Overall M31 is an average phone with nothing as promised by Samsung.

Not Upto the mark

  I have purchased this mobile just 15 days back, and now it getting struck. The features are 8GB/128GB I purchased, worst phone, previously I used Redmi Note 3, in entire 5 years that phone not struck more than 2 to 3 times with 3GB RAM, but this phone has 8GB RAM and it started strucking and really worst phone from SAMSUNG. Except Display no other features are good. So please don't buy such fraud mobile like me. Please think rather you choose other mobiles with same features and less money also. So go for other ones.

I don't recommend this phone.

  Though this phone is having 6gb ram but despite that it is very slow. Out of 6gb, available ram is only 3gb that too without installing any app. After installing required apps, ram available is less than 3gb. Signal problem is very high in this phone. After using jio 4g network, downloading is not up to the mark. Most of the time signals r not available. Before this phone, I was using honor 9lite 3gb ram version. That phone is much better from m31 in speed, network catching, processor etc. I am not satisfied with this phone even by spending 17500/-.

  Fingerprint reader is working very nicely and and camera quality is good but not so good. The battery life of this phone is really good. No doubt the phone is good but not perfect touch is very smooth like the display quality but the body of this phone is really bad its completely plastic body and tha quality of plastic is not good and sometimes phone will be hanging issue.

  Screen dead within a month. Now the samsung service centre is saying that they will take 20 to 25 days to whether they can repair or not and if they can repair they will take one more month to repair. If they can not repair, they say they will give a coupon of samsung which can be used only on samsung that too after one month. The prices on samsung are higher than amazon. So I have to wait 30 to 45 days and pay more to get the same phone.This is bad from samsung. Just don't buy these samsung phones.

  Phone performance detoriated within 2 months from purchase. As the memory is filled 32GB out of 128 GB available, the phone response has drastically reduced. Specifically face recognition, finger print sensing, switching between Apps etc.Also not happy with camera quality (though I'm not an expert but when I capture normal clicks without any settings, quality is not so good which we expect from a 64 MP camera)Battery performance is good till now. Easily lasts for more than a day after exhaustive usage of Web meetings, hot spot, movie etc.

  I like the plastic build of this phone. I also like the buttery smooth one UI 2.0 on top of android 10. The battery life is so good, though the phone takes 3 to 3.5hours for charging from 0 to 100%, the battery life is so good and even it lasts for 1.5days on a full charge.The thing that I dislike in the phone is that the camera performs good in daylight, but when zoomed in, the photos looks pixelated and no sharp image is produced. Not good for lowlight photography. Please samsung provide an update to enhance the clarity of the camera output.

  Face unlock: Slow af, won't recognise you half the time, so basically unusable.Fingerprint unlock: is faster than face unlock, but you need to cover the whole fingerprint reader with your finger, and the reader is unnecessarily big so it's hard to cover it completely sometimes.Battery life: lasts one whole day easily.

Amazon 10 days return period is short for budget phones
",4,"

  The phone's battery got off within 12 days of purchase. Had a harrowing time with the imposing lockdown and moreover with Amazon's short 10 days return period, especially if phones are prone to these setbacks within such a short period. Service Center got it in working condition in 14 days but the phone just feels like a refurbished one now after only 1 month of purchase. Specs are decent as compared to others, hopefully it will last as much as my previous phone.

Good phone with worst Battery life
",5,"

  Writing this review after 6 days usagePros-1) Amazing AMOLED display.2)Fair rare camera3)Lag free operationCons-1)Worst battery life- 6000 Mah battery gives you hardly 1 day backup on wifi with normal uses(Without playing ganes)2) Slowest charging speed- battery takes 2 Hours 45 Minutes for charging from 0 to 100%3) Face unlock is good but not fastStrong battery backup is just a Myth in this case.

I'm not happy
",1,"

  Been 3 months since I bought this, battery now lasts 24 hrs from the initial days(first month) of 36hrs. Same level of usage. Phone is seriously not great, I'm starting to understand why iPhones are always highly priced now. Phone hangs quite easily, gets slow. The processor or the RAM, I'm not a technical guy to explain. But my 3.5 year old iPhone 7 is much better than this.Surely not meant for long time usage, maybe that's why its priced 16k ish. I anticipate 1 to 1.5 years for these phones.

  Received m31 on 21st August, problem started on 29th August. Right after the one day of 7-days replacement warranty. Since return period was over no expectations from Amazon.Problem : Issue with ear piece where other ends voice is low. When we put call on speaker, voice is echoing. I checked if there is any sound mod on like pop or jazz but it was on normal.Biggest issue on 30 Aug. - Charger died. Litterly stopped working.Now I have to depend upon samsung service center.

  Worst cellphone performance. Whenever opens a fresh new application  i can feel there is a lag in opening in compare to my old cellphone. Also while soeaking on cellphone  for more than 10 mins the screen starts getting  heated. The data tranmission speed is reduced during hotspot or without it while browsing social application.

It says 64 MP camera but the shots don't have much details, only good for normal shoots and for posting in social medias. The problem occurs when you zoom in to see any detail in your captured photo, but has good macro camera and good lighting though. But at this price range its a good phone.

Charging speed got reduced.
",1,"

  Intially phone was working good but after normal use of 2 months, it started taking too long in charging, and charging speed after 75% becomes very less.I can say time taken in charging after 75% is twice of time taken upto initial 75%.Samsung customer care suggested charge in different modes, change charger, charging chord etc.I did everything but still issue is same. At last just waiting to visit samsung service center once situation becomes normal and government lifts restrictions.

  Handset looks good. Everything is perfect regarding the phone. Phone is delivered within 2 days. But the packaging is disappointing. They just took the main Samsung box and put it into another cardboard box. No foam or bubble wrap plastic provided. Even the box was not waterproof. You can tell what's inside the box by just looking into gaps. If someone has paid a hefty amount of 17499 , at least you should properly take care all aspects of packaging.

  The charging is relatively slow. 30 minutes of charging gives you about 21% of charge from 0%. After an hour, you're only at about 40% charge.

Worst phone in 17500/-

  This is the worst phone. Totally wastage of money. Battery 6000mah is fake, camera 64 megapixel also fake. Heating issue while recording video. 6000 mah battery gets drained within half of the day instead of less use.I wrote for refund but Amazon is not accepting which is unethical. Replacement is showing but the product is bad only then what replacement will do? I gone for samsung just because of brand but it is fake!

Issue of hang
",2,"

  Not worth it, dont buy it. I purchase it few days back only hardly 15 days happens by looking at its battery size & specification. Battery life is really good, no doubt on it but i am facing the issue which i never thought. Its hangs, with even 6 gb ram still the device hang automatically & that too for 5-10 min & i am unable to do in that situation as battery is non removable in nowdays devices. I really wants to replace it but already 10 days pass so company will not take it back also. Think once while buying this product.

Heats very soon. And very much!

  The features are all fine. But if you use it continuously for 20 minutes, it will get heated to an unbearable extent.I checked if there is any solution for this. The solution is to reduce brightness and use fewer number of apps.But one buys a smartphone to use the apps!

Build Quality is Very Poor. Performance is good

  Display and Performance is good.Product built quality is very poor.- Volume button is loose and goes inside without pressing- camera placement is inclined. One end it projects high and other end it goes into body- Fingerprint print sensor is also inclined. One end it goes deep into body and other end it comes up. So while placing the finger it doesn't feel good.

  Absolutely disappointed, this is the first time that I've bought a Samsung phone and I couldn't have worse experience. I often had them hanging during some important work would be going on. But what would a person do when the phone completely stops working in the middle of the night? Luckily, I was at my home. I had always known that Samsung phones have issues, but having experienced it, I can't really rely on this phone anymore, I've already put it for an exchange.

Check the proper working of the microphone

  I bought this product last week through Amazon. The camera is of high clarity and overall it is a really good phone. But there is something wrong with the mobile's microphone. During a call I end up sounding muffled or far off to the person on the other end even if I am using an earphone. It is really turning out to be a major issue due to the high strain with which I have to speak. I am thinking about returning back the product. Plus the battery too is running out a bit fast. Other than that the product is great and handy.

  3-4minutes of usage and the ph heats up.Called up call center for this keep data and wifi on only when needed.since you are using 3rd party apps like Amazon Tata cliq it gets up..2 min camera usage and ph will heat up that u can't even hold itI dont do gaming ,no video watching,if will keep data off and dont use apps what is the use of having a smart phone.3red Samsung  phone and really disappointed.

  Samsung! Big name big brand... but they bluff with catchy features. When a 4000mah battery of mi can last at an average for 2 days,, how come a 6000mah battery would last same?? Even it gets disgarged more rapidly than 4000mah.Its better wait for mi 9 pro max sell and buy that phone

  i am really disappointed with the Samsung galaxy m31.I was facing network issues all time with my jio sim as well as airtel sim,I was check all the settings but no solution found ,even though i changed my jio sim but the result is same.I think samsung is a good brand they should fix the problem otherwise they will loose their faith.

  Don't go for this phone if you see it's configuration. I never expected from this from Samsung. Camera quality is absolutely poor. Where is 6000 mah battery performance. They says its fast charging. Comparatively it's very slow in charging. Overhaul,  nothing is better.

  I found only 10 watts Charger in the box in place of 15 watts standard one. It is a big pilferage by the company which is not expected from Samsung or Amazon.

  Battery back up is like 4000mah not as 6000mah because it is giving only one day battery backup.It is not expected from samsung brand.Camera is as usual from samsung.It is not like other companies phones camera which gives more attractive photos.Fingerprint sensor is not as fast as mentioned in features.Overall this mobile is average mobile. I expected more than this from Samsung.

  We need to handle any smartphone carefully, but Samsung phone we need to take utmost additional care because it has LED touch screen, my screen got damaged even when there is a temper glass within a 1.5 months time..

Samsung m31

  Never thought that Samsung would provide such a phone for 17000 rupees.  The phone is very slow. The quality of the 64 MP camera is nothing special.  It takes a long time to launch a game.  The preview of the picture taken shows after a long time.Very poor performance of charging. It takes three plus hours for full charging.it means fast charging features means nothing.😑😔😔

  Very cheap build quality, very weak WI-FI connectivity. Don't choose seeing the number of battery 6000mAh, battery backup is good but i thik there don't have 6000mAh.

  I am writing this review after using this device for 3 months. M31 6GB/128GB.Most poor series from Samsung. Full of Ad operating system.Lack of effective functioning, features respond slowly.Batter life is good.Fingerprint reader not at all good.Camera quality is average.No split window facility.

Screen cracked
",2,"

  Nothing wrong with the way the phone functions. My kid threw the phone, and screen cracked. Screen had tempered glass and phone had silicon back cover. Nothing helped. Looks like build is pretty bad. Service center doesn't have replacment screens available. Might take more than 15 days it seems. And cost is more than 5K.

  What i found out is that the processor sucks the battery at the highest level and heats up at another level. Qualcomm is just much better choice in the field of processing.

Mobile not worth the price
",3,"

  The mobile is not worth the price for which it is bought. Picking up the phone becomes difficult, it suddenly hangs and even if able to pickup the voice from other side is so slow that it is difficult to hear. I think the piece I had  received is repaired one. I bought  it only by the name of Samsung.Can something be done about it?

Mobile is over heating.
",3,"

  Mobile is over heating and not able to do whatsapp video call more than half an hour. It start giving message that mobile is overheated because of whatsapp video call, you call will be ended in 20 sec. Battery backup is also not that much good. For normal use like whatsapp & facebook, it provides backup of 8-10 hours. Camera quality is also not that much good.

  I bought Samsung Mobile 3 days ago. Then I found that this mobile camera does not burn 64 megapixel and the size of the camera has to be set and repeatedly. And the right voice from Mike does not hear the front caller. Then this mobile is working on the old software, such as there is no facility of call records. The network is very weak of this mobile.

  This phone's battery takes a lot of time to charge. It takes around 2 to 2.30 hrs to charge. Very unhappy about it.

  Product is good. Battery life is not as advertised, although it gives a decent run once charged (will last a day on single charge with average internet use). Back body is plastic, so you won't get that premium feel. Overall it's a phone to multitask.

I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

A fab phone at this price!

  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

My Real Review - M31 is Average
",5,"

  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

  Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true.

  I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually

  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

HONEST REVIEW BY USER
",5,"

  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)

Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it

  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.

For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR

  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

  Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

BAAP of Power and features
",1,"

  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

  Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardwareFinally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.Infact my first samsung phone.While configuration, received security patch and UI updatesFrom user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefullySuper happy user since 3days.

  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

Superb Budget Phone by Samsung
",4,"

  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.

  From the user of Samsung Guru 1200, Metro duos C3322, Mertro XL, Galaxy On5 Pro to this Galaxy M31 & going to use Note series after some months & as a Samsung fan I'm honestly writing this review. This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.

No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .

  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)

  Pros:1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great2. Really a monstrous battery3. Selfie camera is better4. Fingerprint sensor is fast5. OS is fluidic without any lag6. Call quality and reception is good7. No ads and the default Apps can be deletedNeutral:1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the NokiasCons:1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.2. Phone is little heavyConclusion:If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point

  1.Good Camera but produces Noise in Indoor Lighting Conditions Could be Fixable through an OTA Update.2.Very Good Battery Life.3.Good Display but lacks HDR 10 support.4.Processor Gives Average performance compare to Qualcomm Snapdragon Processors but its sufficient for Normal People Who don't play Heavy Graphics Related Games.5.Physical Fingerprint Scanner is Quite Fast But An In Display Fingerprint Scanner Would Give Better Experience On This Smartphone.6.Software on this device is Smooth like a Butter and Packs Some Really Good Features but Real-time Network Speed Option Should Have Been Provided For Better Experience On This Device.Maybe Samsung Could provide this feature thought OTA Update Later On.7.This Phone Comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but They should Provided Corning Gorilla glass 5 as other brands are providing in this price range.

Better but not Best from Samsung !!
",5,"

  Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.

Good replacement for J series in this price tag
",4,"

  Fair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.

   The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.

Best battery life in mid range segment phone

  I bought this phone for my dad and Samsung is known for the durability plus 6000 mah battery is the highlight of this phone so it has long battery life also camera quality is good too. I bought this phone at freedom sale so I get a discount of 10 percent on the price so its a good deal.... If long battery life and durability is your purpose for phone then go for it without any thought.

  I recently purchased m31 mobile set. I am very much frustrated with the net connection. In my area Airtel network is very strong. But the internet connection is automatically disconnected in this mobile. Do everything but could not solve the problem. In the past I had used same data. There was no problem. But after purchasing m31 set I  am fully dissatisfied with the data service. In the data symbol only  uploading arrow blinking. Downloading arrow stops blinking after sometime. I think this is a hardware problem. Please arrange to replace my mobile as early as a possible.Add tags

  I have used Redmi mobiles for the past 3 years. I just wanted to change to Samsung for a change of experience. And you know what, it's turned out to be a good decision. Samsung Galaxy is an absolute beast. It looks elegant and operates smoothly with quite a lot of good quality features. I am enjoying using this mobile.Pros:* camera: video and image quality and available modes are too good at this price. It's good to have a 64MP camera. It works well in night light also.* Battery life is good.* No heating issues found while using and charging, unlike redmi mobiles.* No need of unnecessary mandatory apps installation like in redmi.* I feel like this mobiles  GUI is amazing and better than Redmi mobiles GUI (maybe because I got bored using redmi mobiles??).* Dolby sound system is too good. You can feel the difference if you compare audio quality with other mobile phones audio.* Smart switch app from Samsung helps to copy all the data from your previous mobile to this one. It's a good feature.* This mobile operates so smoothly.*Amoled display is amazing.Cons:* Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.Overall a good experience and recommended product.Just a suggestion, if you are buying this mobile please spend 500 more bucks and buy Spigen back cover, mobile looks elegant with it. You will love your mobile more. Dont go for cheap quality back covers. You will regret it later.Update: After using it for 1 month, I have found that the internet speed is bit low when compared to other mobiles and sometimes internet disconnects automatically for some seconds.

  It's been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a ""Made in India"" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience

Overall highly satisfied with the phone

  Received the phone 20 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.

  I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.

  Feedback:I Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 1 minutes after-sale starts. This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after a few days of usage and Again I re-order from this same model same colour and same configuration. price range very attractive and all requirement full fill. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery (More than 1.5 Days running with Internet)- 512 GB Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodBuild Quality:This phone is fully made of plastic but the build quality is good. The back of the phone looks like glass but it also made from plastic so it scratches easily. So, use a Back Cover.Overall Rating:- Camera 5/5- Performances 5/5- Display 5/5 - Super Amoled Display- Battery 5/5- 6000 Mah- Phone look 4/5 (This phone is fully made of plastic)- User interface 5/5 - New Samsung One UI 2 is awesome- Sound 5/5 - Dolby atmos Enhanced very much sound effect on Headset.Go for it without any doubt.

  Writing this review after 10 days of usage.Pros:1. Samsung's Super AMOLED Screen2. Massive 6000 mAh battery3. 64 MP Quad Camera4. One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box5. Dolby Atmos SupportCons:1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B. I am not a gamer. I haven't done any gaming. You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.

Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.

  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode.

But camera quality can be better as per this price segment.If you are camera lover then you can go for other phones.Macro camera is worst.4 stars4:-Performance :- Not upto the mark. Sometimes there is a lag. 3.5 stars5:- Games :- If you are game lover then do go for this. 3 stars6:- Storage :- Go with 128 GB storage option don't go for 64 GB 4 starsSo now it's your choice which option you want to go.The charger cable which is received is of low quality and it's very loose. The packing of the phone was not that much good. Not expected from samsung. The phone was having a heavy dust on it when received.

Worth for every penny

  Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

  Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone

  I thoroughly like this mobile.Very smooth to handle.The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.

  Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.

Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.Sound quality is also up to the markThe phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.The face unlock feature is above everything.It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.I think everyone should try this experience.I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.I am very happy to write this review.I think this review you make impact a bit.Just stop here and buy this product.After using it you would be feel that your decision was right.Thank you for reading my review till last.

  Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .Screen doesn't give Natural colours.Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .The software has better options .Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .Charging cable is too short .Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome

  I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!

Not just a phone it's your Need choose wisely😇

  It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirementThank you 😁

The best phone in this price segment.
",4,"

  My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash

Good product,  delivery & seller

  Very good product. I read about the concerns on the camera but still decided to go ahead. The mobile is fantastic. Camera, OS everything is good. This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack. Overall, had a great experience - product, delivery and the  seller.

  Its almost 3 months now. Giving review about this phone:PROS:1) Made In India, in Noida factory.2) Very good touch screen. You don't require screen guard, as its scratch resistant/scratch free.3) Superb battery life.4) Doesn't get heated after prolonged use.CONS:1) It doesn't have block number feature with prefix pattern. You have to add individual numbers. E.g. you know call starting with 140 are all advertisement calls. You can't ignore them simply by adding 140*, you have to individually add. Trucaller has this feature, but you require to install this 3rd party APP.2) SAMSUNG claims its a 15W charger. But if you know Wattage is Volt X Current. Its 5V, 2A charger, that is 10W. In short its weaker charger than what company claims.3) Its touch screen is very sensitive. If soap water etc gets on to the screen then even after cleaning by cloth, screen doesn't respond for long time. ""Accidental touch feature"" if you put ON then especially you get into this issue.Overall:Overall for this range with brand like SAMSUNG, its definately a good BUY. Much better than Chinese phones.

  if you are purchasing forCamera - you can do better than this.Games - you can do much better.Battery life - even this will do , please do not expect miracles from 6000 figure.Phone , map , whats app or lots of apps ( productive apps not entertainment types ) at this cost with nice to touch feel - yes this is the phone you should consider.Screen - please buy this , screen image quality is so good , even a dull photo looks good.Phone looks - nothing jazzy , plain and simple15W charging is okay not fast types and when charging 6000 battery is like back to old school.Sound - a bit weak but its okay if you become DJ just once in two months.Software or bloatware - Samsung have better and useful products which all are not provided with this model as its a mid range but what all is given in not sufficient but with that kind of RAM and storage , go get how many do you like.Charger is not small but charging cable isGorilla glass is effectivePhone is not slim but far from uncomfortable.

  I have been using this phone for quite some time now and I consider myself eligible to review it. Initially, I was very confused if I should be going for M21 or M31 but glad that I chose the latter.Pros:Excellent quad camera and front cameraThe battery lasts for 1.5 days with minimal gamingUI is really cool compared to other Chinese brandsMade in India & most importantly the majority of the parts are not from ChinaCons:Charging takes time (approx 2.5 - 3hrs) considering it is 6000 mah batteryBuild quality could have been better (all plastic)Charger wire is shorter compared to all the other brands which I used earlierTips:Charge your phone in airplane mode and it will be quickerBuy tempered glass on Amazon only as offline tempered glasses from the roadside are not good and will hamper the clarity of the screenBack case is recommended as the phone is prone to scratchesPurchased Boxxo tempered glass from Amazon along with Valueactive carbon filter back case. Both are good and protect your phone to a great extent and also enhances its looks

Samsung M31 is a star in the galaxy of its kind.

  Samsung Galaxy M31 did resonate to me, with another ‘M31’ - Andromeda Galaxy.In the universe of mobile-phones, Samsung M31 is a star in the galaxy of its kind.Why Samsung?Intrinsically, I am a fan of Samsung products.Excellent product design and manufacturing. Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.Why M31?In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So  I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.The Samsung M31.The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display.The hardware is perfectly matched with its operating syste. I was amazed using its never-used-before features. I found, there's more than one way to peel an apple. With its 6000 mAh battery the phone is very thin and light. Finally, true value for money.

Best in it's range!
",4,"

  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)

  2 STAR TO 4 STARDEAR ALLIM writing the review after usage of Samsang M31 after one month. The below review was written after 2-3 days of usage of same. But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.👍👍👍👍🤳Thx allMy early review👇Very much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time 🤣🤣🤣If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.

  Hello All..I'm writing this review after few months of usage, but this should not be different as per my experience. I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON

Battery drained by 10% only.Phone is light weight.Wifi calling.5G wifi support.Loved this dark mode.Samsung VPN.Cons:Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.Camera quality is average.Full charge requires 2 hrs.Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.

  I orderded 8 GB ram with 128 GB storage. Seriously, samsung is doing remarkable in this segment. I was Iphone user and seriously I purchased this phone to get more handy with android OS.Camera: Too good. Many options and works in almost all condition.Sound: Dolby supports to Bluetooth and wired headphones. AmazingDisplay: No competition.. sAMOLED is doing its best. The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)

  I had been waiting to buy this smartphone since its launch. It has been a couple of days using it and I am very satisfied with the experience. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone in a jiffy. The battery lasted over a day with moderate to high usage, including surfing, watching YouTube videos, using Spotify and making two long calls. It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good. Overall, it checks all the boxes, and makes it a true tool for the user.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a decent budget phone. In this range it is definitely the mega monster that it claims to be.

Non-Chinese Brand phone for Indians
",5,"

  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.

  I am using my new phone for almost a month now. The phone looks great and value for money to me. The delivery of Amazon was perfect. I will list down the pros and cons below:Pros1. Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass.  Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.

  Got SG M31 more than a week ago. Ran into issues. Got in touch with CC and Tech support. They arranged a tech visit. Tech visit confirmed issues with the phone -- a replacement was done. Got a smooth working phone now and I have no complaints. Infact I want to thank all those involved in getting me  a replacement.Now for the phone itself. Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage. Maybe I dont know how to use it. Overall a good phone and highly recommended. Happy bought a made in India phone will sell my old redmi note 6 pro to some anti-national.

Some issues. But buy with pride.
",5,"

  Many people have written a lot about this phone. So let me give you my quick observation:1. Screen is good, but has yellow tint. People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!

AWESOME CAMERA, GREAT BATTERY AND GOOD PERFORMANCE

  Starting with display as its sAMOLED its great.Camera 64MP main shooter is awesome, great details and color reporduction , slefie is nice too, ultra wide depth and macro works as described but main highlght is 64 MP which actualy is great.Battery life is superb but takes 2:30+ to charge from 10 to 100.Perfomance of 9611 is very nice, it does not lag in daily uses. PUBG in HD and ultra or HD smooth works very good for long hours of play. HDR with ultra lags sometimes. But HD ultra is the best setting for 1 hour of gaming.Last is build quality, i have blue and i thought it might look cheap plastic as seen in pictures , but blue looks semi premium , its not thick or bulky, when u have in hand its great.it does not have NFC so if you are in use of it then go for A51 else M31 is actualy a good deal . Totaly worthit and plus  samsung brand. Also note samsung has improved  a lot in updates. Plus no advertisements.

  Yes, the phone turns out to be knocking in terms of battery and other functionalities are also fine except wifi. Whenever i switch the phone on i have to manually open the wifi settings to connect it to the auto-connected wifi which had already saved. I don't know this is an issue with my handset or everyone, haven't contacted CC in this regard as not a huge issue. The main thing processor and ram management is also fine as mated with 8gb, but it's not meant for heavy gaming. As i play pubg and all.. fame do drop sometimes as i've noticed, which was not the story with my asus 5z 8gb variant, i miss that phone.But in terms of battery it's surely a deal breaker! It's only bout 2 weeks with me.. will update here if find out something new. Uptill now thanks to amazon and samsung!

Best phone under 17k? Yes  5/5 stars.
",5,"

  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.

  Battery: 10/10Display: 10/10Sound: 10/10 (Don't expect stereo effect sound at this price. The Dolby Atmos effect that you get through the earphones is however appreciable.)Look & Feel: 9/10 (It has a plastic back, but at this price, a plastic back is justifiable).Camera: 9/10 (I am not a big fan of cellphone camera, but intial impression is 9/10.)User Experience: 9/10 (The phone does not lag as of 5 days of usage. I have disabled most of the Samsung apps, but still few Samsung apps can't be uninstalled or disabled.)

SAMSUN M31- My review
",5,"

  I bought the mobile in the first day of its release and writing this review after almost 3 months.For a normal user without gaming and all..,Pros:1.  Good battery backup2.  Good display and hence we can watch movies and series also in this.Cons:1. Very dangeruos to use without screen guard or case. Display got broke on the second day and when I went to Samsung service centre.., they said the charge for changing display is Rs. 5500. which is very costly.2.  Cant use it in one hand and the sensitivity is so high that even before pressing BACK button.., when typing something automatically that gets executed and it goes to a different screen. We get irritated all the time that happens3. Face unlock is not up to the mark.In a sentence, I am not a satisfied customer because of the above issues.

Amazing Phone at this price range
",1,"

  After using the phone for 3 months, i am writing this review.Pros:- Battery backup- Dual 4G Dual WiFi calling- High Quality LED Display- Camera in HDR mode- Sleek design- SpeedCons:- initially had restarting issues, later resolved after software update- Heats up on long video calls and battery drains fast due to high quality video- Camera could have been better, zooms in digital mode, not optical- Security lock function for each app not availableOverall an excellent phone at this price range with an excellent battery backup. You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM & 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.Mangal S

The Display can alone make all the money paid worth every penny
",5,"

  I chose to purchase this because of two things : The display, having already used the M30. And, the humongous 6000mAH Battery.As for the battery, I have received something even better. The m31 display is an upgrade over the M30. I don't know if I am wrong, but it is more crisp and has better contrast.But however I am disappointed with the battery. Even though it is 1000 mAh higher capacity, I have not noticed any significant difference over M30.But this is again compensated by a far better camera than the M30. The M30 camera was pathetic to say the least.This is however not as good as a realme or redmi. But, the display is light years better than the realmes or mis.

Remarkable Monster smartphone from Samsung

  1. Price:The price for which the smartphone is available is much more affordable and more featureful than any other competitors.2. Battery:The battery really supprts the tagline monster battery which really helps the phone to last atleast 2 days of battery backup.3. Specifications :The price bracket for the smartphone offered the specs is more powerful than the others.4. Product Quality:The sturdiness of smartphone is really good and the case provided in the box really helps the phone to be more safe.5. Camera:The camera offers quad camera setup which is also more brighter in night and ultra wide features help me get all in one frame, and quality is also really very good.Overall Screen, Specifications, Build Quality is remarkable made by Samsung.

  Having owned a top range galaxy S8 which did not live upto its quality, I was pretty sure I did not want to spend a ruppee more than 15-16k of my hard earned money. Clearly did not want a Chinese brand so opted for this one and boy I am surprised by the specs, battery, screen resolution, camera, overall performance you name it. Speaker quality is okay but if you use headphone for music or watching your latest show this will be of your least concern. You will need a phone cover coz the polycarbonate is definitely a fingerprint magnet.When phone like these can address all your needs then why to spend crazy amount of money ? Usse accha Sensex mein daalo appreciation hoga:) Be prudent.

Worthy Phone with amazing display
",4,"

  ProsAmazing display quality.Top notch clarity on Amazon Prime on par with OnePlus kind of phones.Camera quality is great in 64pixel mode back cam and 32 pixel mode front cam. Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.Battery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.General processing, speed and animations are seamless.if you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.Finger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.ConsAudio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.I am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.Has a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.Exynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.Extra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.Larger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.Over all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.

  VALUE BUYING **** (for me)Good NON-CHINESE mobileOverall performance is good but for INR 17500/- Processor chipset can be improved and didn't like the back design and builtin quality - can be metal. I got this mobile in the exchange for my old Redmi Note 3. So, for me value buying.But, if you see, in this pandemic situation (COVID19) and geopolitical scenario, when India is planning to ban Chinese Products, Samsung has a great opportunity to acquire Indian Market and can deliver flagship mobiles by reducing the price.Pros:1. Display2. Battery backup3. Wide-angle camera pictures4. Dolby Atmos is a good experienceCons: 1. BUILTIN QUALITY (made up of plastic) -->> could be metal built2. As per the price range, PROCESSOR CAN BE IMPROVED.3. AGGRESSIVE PRICING4. The back should be glass5. Camera performance can be improved in low light condition#ChinaKoJawaab #wallet_power

  I am using this phone almost for three months and it's performance is promising so far !Fingerprint sensor is very responsiveFace unlock knows how to do his job preety well !Gaming is upto the mark !Can play Asphalt 9 on highest level without any sweat!PUBG ? You know the rest (Fabulous preformance)Battery is massive and works almost 1 and a half days after using it heavyly (approx for 10 hrs straight!!)About the camera ,it has some cons in somePicture modes for example,In the mode of wide angle, when we capture photo in low light it has plenty of noise in it, when we use normal slow motion mode the recorded clip shows some lags, stuttering. But that's fixable by further software update so hope Samsung will fix that soon!Except that the device is Masterpiece in such a good price !

A beast by its value for money

  Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.

  I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last 10 days. I feel I made best choice this time.1. Android v10.0 OS with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor really good performance. No lagging.2. Excellent Display. Blue ligth filter is cool.3. 6000 mah battery is very usefull for continuous user like me. Fast charging & no heating problem.4. Camera is good. Macro performance is very good. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.5. Both dedicated sim slots support LTE.6. Mobile speakers sound is good but when I use earphone I am not getting full clarity.7. Finger print sensor response is compartively very good.8. When I ordered phone I was thinking it is big size but it is very handy..!9. Storage expandable upto 512GB is really usefull.I feel phone is really worth for the price & you may like to use it. Without doubt you may order.

Quite good

  A nice phone for Rs 16000. It also manages tonplay asphalt 9 on highest graphics settings. Yes i did face a bit of heating issue. To solve it, update the firmware to latest version, Reduce brightness to minimum , turn on battery saver and turn on dark mode. It wiil solve most of the heating problem. U would still get a little heat while steaming youtube video, whatsapp video call or playing games or doing a phone call for some time or simply charging the phone but that's quite normal for any android phone

Good Phone

  Bought this product when launched at its lowest price, had to wait quiet long for the product after intense surveying because I was avoiding high end phones because life of each phone is nearly same, and during the pandemic it was of utmost importance to save each penny instead of spending freely and also wanted to avoid phones manufactured by China.I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.

  Hello everyoneI was looking for a Chinese  budget smartphone since last 2 months..but when this boycott Chinese thing started.. I changed my mind.. and started looking for a made in india device.. samsung m31 is the one you are looking for under 20000. I have the 128+6 gb version.. the battery is super cool.. camera is also decent even in the night time. The night mode captures decent photos at night. The processor is decent and handle the apps pretty good.. despite of having a huge battery the phone is comparatively lite.. and it feels comfortable because of the edge on the side.. it helps in the better grip. Super amoled display is just wow.. better colours..accurate sharpness. Overall the phone is very good.. go for it without any doubtI hope this review is helpful.

  Writing this review after two weeks of usage. The phone has some weight to it, which is something I was looking for and it really feels good to hold in hand just like the old rugged Motorola's.Display and the battery capacity are something which impressed me a alot and I can definitely vouch for it. Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.

Wow, Beauty in your hands with Dolby Sound and Fantastic camera, and stunning Screen clarity
",4,"

  This is the one of the very best phones I used till now. Screen Clarity is fantastic due to AMOLED. very wide screen, Music experience from Dolby atmosphere in this phone is outstanding. Now, I'm hearing every minute detail of sound, which I never heard in normal phones without dolby, of course your earphones also must be good enough to give the true output of dolby atmos. Battery backup is the most plus point for this model, which comes easily for 1 and half day with heavy usage in different ways. And blue colour of this model is very decent. No lag, smooth butter flow in working.There are too many options for camera in this, if u r a camera focused person. Perfect clarity of videos n photos.  Thank you Samsung for producing good phones n also Amazon for delivering safely.

  From my experience of using M31 for the past one month-Pros:It is one of the best smartphones in this price range.Battery life is superb and also not heavy even if it's 6000 mah.As usual display is the best part of samsung phone.Cons:Design is not cool. Better use back cover.Don't expect much for camera, its just average only.Not at all a gaming phone, ita processor is not fast and the phone could not provide high frame rate.Can play pubg smoothly with medium frame rate and low graphics.

Great for camera freaks and exhaustive users ( extended battery life)
",4,"

  Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.

Indeed an all Rounder - Avoid critical reviews lead by unlearned, Pessimistic users & go for it.

  YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY THIS IS SUPER MONSTER. MUST-READ.Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.

Ultimate Smartphone under 17K
",4,"

  Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .Pros :1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .Cons :1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.

Best value for money phone with 8gb RAM and 128gb Storage

  I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.

  I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons•Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.Pros•Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....

Best Phone for the price

  This is a all rounder -1. Battery life is good, Though it would have made a little more sense if they had provided a better wattage charger then 15W. Plus side the battery life would last longer so.2. Camera quality is good. Though some reviews say not up to the mark - as the issue is there a separate option to use 4:3 64 MP which needs to be selected. Out of the box the default settings is 4:3 16 MP. This should help differentiate. This is in a way ok as 64 MP will use a lot of space for each picture as the size ratio is high.3. Display is the best as always.4. RAM any thing from 4 GB works well - Moderate use not talking about heavy gaming.5. Overall happy with the product and price is the best for such spec.

But even than voice on other side is not good)Back is plastic and not glass like other modern phone of this segment.Samsung launched it at cheaper price. Perhaps revised rates after some time.Overall - Good mobile. Will give you better feel than Xiaomi or Realme.

  The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.

Samsung m31 review.. very good phone for the budget

  I mainly got samsung for its battery life.. usually I'm comfortable with Nokia for its battery life and rough handling..and previously I had Nokia sirocco..  this time I was considering poco and samsung m 31.. it's a good budget phone with very good battery life.. I use it for watching videos and it comes for 2 days.. camera quality is good for me, though not like nokia 8 ,but good enough for the price..I don't take selfies.. I've put the phone down from hip level 3 times accidentally and it has not broken so far.. better to have a flip cover for protection.. so my overall experience is very good as I got it after reading a lot of specifications.. I don't play games so I don't know about that.. why I didn't choose poco or redme was coz of the ads and battery life..hope it helps..

Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of ""fast charging"", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.

  For camera:Change lens to 64 mp in camera setting. Change camera resolution to fhd or uhd.Using macro requires a little bit of understanding.Battery has 3 modes always keep on medium amd check the optimised button. While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM. Also set the time to automatically clean your phone.Samsung UI is extremely good. It resembles stock android and the bloat ware is not annoying.Screen is next level. sAMOLED screen does its job.

Best Samsung all rounder in July 2020
",4,"

  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.

  No Regret Mobile Phone. Samsung has improved a Lot. I have used till Note 10 & shifted to iPhone. I bought this M31 to gift to my wife. I am amazed to see the wow 😮 Performance of this M31. Stunning 64MP Quad camera to document your life, immersive viewing with 16.21cm (6.4"") Infinity-U Display, 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging. Superb Battery Life.

  It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ✌️ continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs

Phone switches to WiFi calling automatically
",5,"

  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.

  Bought this phone instead of an iPhone SE 2020 as I was seriously looking to get rid of the crappy Chinese junk that I had been using do far. Done basic online research and I realised that both the M31 & A51 run the same processor. However M31 comes with a much bigger battery and a better camera both important features in my decision making. It's been a little over a month and I have no regrets. The phone is butter smooth in operation while I get a proper two day battery break up. The camera is sharp and produces amazing results. This is a phone for people who want a phone for basic day to day working. Emails calls browsing and reading selling with social media and watching videos all of it the phone does masterfully well. Gamers may not like this handset but they are a different segment altogether and this phone is not for that segment. I would recommend this to anyone with my eyes closed.

Very much unsatisfying with Cameras

  Camera clarity is same as 48mp in Redmi note 8. There is no difference. 5MP macro is very waste comparing with 2MP macro in Redmi note 8 (better) and I am Very much upset that in this price range samsung is not providing the clarity  and IR blaster which is not included.  One more thing I don't know why Samsung is not providing headphones now, there is no back case or screen guard.  Please try to include.Not satisfied with CAMERA @ 64MP rear and 34MP Front..  these figures are just for mentioning only but not providing actual clarity.And one more thing..This product is not a scratch proof glass/ Corning gorilla glass. Scratches has happening continuous while putting in the pocket.

  Soo this phone is good to buy. It has a decent processor. It has great battery life. Its camera quality is a little bit low in low light or medium light but great in daylight. Selfie camera is great better than most of the phones in this budget range. I have seen some lags in this phones.....not much but still. Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg. Speakers are good but in headphone u got dolby atmos support which makes experience of listening music games in headphones great.

  One serious issue i got after using it for a month, and i also read many similar comments in samsung community that is the restart issue. The phone sometimes restarts suddenly when we are still using it. And I really dont get any clue why this happens. No warnings, no reasons displayed. It just restarts suddenly..It has happens approx 6-7times during the last month.Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.Overall it's a very good phone.

  Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.

Bang for the buck. Go for it!

  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.

Must buy if looking for real Smart Phone-Value for money- Samsung M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB )

  The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs.

It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.64MP + 8MP + 5MP + 5MP rear camera | 32MP front facing camera 16.21 centimeters (6.4-inch) FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution, 404 ppi pixel density and 16M color support Memory, Storage & SIM: 6GB RAM | 64GB storage expandable up to 512GB | Dual SIM with dual standby (4G+4G) Android v10.0 operating system with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor 6000mAH lithium-ion battery 1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase Box also includes: Travel Adapter, USB Cable, Ejection Pin, User Manual Fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor | Dual SIM (nano+nano) with dual standby and dual VoLTE , Dedicated Sim slot;Widevine L1 certification for HD streamingSamsung is my unprecedented favorite brand and I never used any other brand.

Featuring the advanced version of its forerunner, the mid-range smartphone has an impressive quad-camera set-up, powerful device maker's chipset with 6GB RAM, large battery capacity with fast-charging functionality and an abundantly expandable in-built storage space. The phone is a viable option for users who are looking for a decent performer at a budget.Upgraded Variant of M30Display and CameraThe Samsung Galaxy M31 128GB gets a Super AMOLED display size of 6.4 inch (16.26cm) along with a screen resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403ppi pixel density, which adds brilliantly vivid streaming in the device.

In terms of connectivity, the Galaxy M31 offers 4G Volte network, dual-SIM, USB Type-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and A-GPS with GLONASS.Design• Decent looks and build quality - very similar to the Samsung Galaxy M30s, with a a unibody polycarbonate design, and glossy finish on the back panel - the only major difference is the camera module which now packs a fourth camera• The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 191 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000 mAh battery• It also feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front• Modern, Infinity-U front - bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin - you still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great• Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach• The power button and volumes are quite flush with the frame which means they lack that tactile, clicky feel• Design feels a bit dated and underwhelming, there is no spark in Galaxy M31's design as we see in other brand's phones like Xiaomi and RealmeDisplay• Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket• It also comes with ""Widevine L1"" certification, which helps stream content in crisp HD resolution• Blacks are deep on the AMOLED display, which looks good with Night mode enabledSoftware• Samsung's OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that's especially well optimised for large displays like this• One UI also brings in other useful stuff, like a System-wide Dark mode (which turns the background completely black, and looks great on the M30s' AMOLED display), and Always On Display option

  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company’s own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.

  Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.after five month of usage till now I won't change my opinion one of the best mobile in this segment. But now Samsung  m31 s is the best competition but SAR value is very low in this mobile. Samsung is best one.

  This was bought for my father. He was v skeptic buying this. We got this for 20,500 on emi. The phone reached in proper condition. The phone comes only with a charger & a pin to open the sim slot. What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par. I am not impressed with the can quality. The music is playing well. All ok. Nothing wow about this phone.. just glad it will serve the purpose for my father. Will edit this review once I find out how is the phone working actually.

I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users

One awesome Korean phone in midst of sea of Chinese spy garbage.

  I used moto g 5 plus for 3 years before this. After having extensively used Samsung m31 for two days I am in love with the software as well as its hardware. There's tonnes of features in this OS optimised by Samsung. There's redmi note 8 users in my house and I can tell you that those phones are absolute Sh!t in front of m31. This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features. I hate notches on phones but the one on this is great and doesn't disturb the functionality of display. Great phone to buy overall. And bonus : this is not a Chinese spy phone.

THE COMPLETE REVIEW

  Yeah after 15 days of usage..heres my review about samsung galaxy m31PROS1.Amoled display of course the (best in midrange smartphones.)2.camera quality is awesome u must know fully about it and use.(I have attached a couple of shots.)3.Mega battery (lasts one day even if u do 5 hrs of gaming and 2 hrs of watching videos).4.Brand resale value of Samsung.5.Processor is fantastic for everyday usage and good for gaming.6.unexpectedly fingerprint  sensor works so good.CONS1.Stereo speakers are not so loud..they are just aaudible.2.Not a glass back just a polycarbonate body.3.Its an internet model and back covers are not available though im nt a backcover user but i tried finding some in the local market.4.Only two colour options.5.charging takes 2 and half hours to completely charge the device.6.some heating issue when using wifi.FINAL VERDICTThis is an awesome mobile from samsung that competetes with the likes of poco x2 and newly launched moto fusion plus.If u love an perfect brand to buy which gives  regular updates to keep the phone upto date then defintely go for it.😁

  After using 1 month, 6GB-64GB varient, Black colourPros:●Good Battery. I am a bit heavy user, still end of the day (6am to11am)40% Remains. I chatted for 3 hours and it sucks 5%battery only. Thats damm cool.●UI is very smooth and handy.●Screen quality is just awsome.●No heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps)●Fingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.Cons:●Cam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.●I prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.● Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.●Charging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.

Very good phone at this price range currently in market

  Update from my end after 2+ months of use: heat issues has been sorted out after few updates. You can confidently buy this phone at this price range (15-18K).Call Quality - 10/10, crystal clear voiceNetwork quality - 10/10Camera - 6/10 (64mp or 48mp is just numbers now a days, doesn't work like expected). But one thing, Photos in night is really awesome, better than even high end phones I can confidently say.Previous feedback was:______________Heating issue. I have requested return. Heating very much near ear speaker/camera area/top area of mobile (even without charge or apps open). I'll  keep you posted regarding status after 10 days too.

  Samsung M31 is wow for its battery. Fingureprint reader is very nice it recognized very quickly, someime I found it's  unresponsive (3times in a 2 month) so used face recognition  or have to use PIN. Camera I like to use 64mp main camera at 3:4. It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.  All other camera are  good too. Video quality is very good. All I'm very satisfied for having Samsung M31 phone.

READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT

  Not the best phone on the market. can never come close to their flagship phones. So many features are not there. Its like it's made to feel midrange. The camera is horrible. Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion. You can trust me here I have a lot of smartphone experience...

  Among the range of below 20K, this is the Smartphone, everyone should blindly go with buying without any second thought.It has the needed Elegant look, amazing screen display, camera, battery, Classy feel, etc. JUST GO FOR IT!! This phone has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.Check the detailing of the camera took in the dark in the pic uploadedI have also recommended to my friends and families, and post me I have made them buy too :)

  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!

REVIEW AFTER USING 15 DAYS
",4,"

  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it's Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it's configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in ""Cons""- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can't have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren't that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.

  Wonderful product!!Glad I bought this.It is more than 3 months now since I bought this phone!Battery life is excellent! I use my phone with wifi and data on with multiple apps running together. Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.  I had seen few poor reviews about the camera, but it turned out good.The finger print reader is quick and responsive.Overall good value for money! With a sturdy back cover and a tempered glass it Is good to go.

  Best alternative for chinese phones by samsung . Not some major flaws but it would have been more great if there was a glass back than a plastic one but it's not that major flaw just put a good cover and  you are good to go. It has an good battery of 6000 mah and goes for 2 days straight . Camera is excellent . The combination of four cameras make the photo look awesome . The fingerprint reader is also good and fast . Samsung has given a seamless experience with stock android and no pre installed apps . I will recommend this phone to buy with closed eyes . Best phone under 20000 rs just go for it without further thoughts .

  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store. That's bit of a pain.OS Software: 5/10

  Camera is something personally wanted to be better. Otherwise it's a complete package for an indian user. Rough usage and regular users will love this phone.. under this budget u may get many options but not the stunning display quality like samsung. If u are looking something that feels best for videos and pocket too..  Here it is. Go for it. Samsung delivers the best in class display quality. I have 4 samsung smart phones. And its a trust worthy review. Might not be a gaming phone but a perfect regular user's companion.

  Firstly I want to describe the phone's external structure :->the phone is very slim .>Holding the 6000mah battery still it is very light.>but for the people with the short fingers it is hard to access the finger print scanner.The security of the phone:->It gives you the access of finger print scanner. It recognizes and the finger opens the lock very fast.>there is also face scaneer which opens the phone preety fast.>no one can access the phone with out the access of phone passwords.Specs of the camera are the following👇>64 mp rear cam is very good compared relatively to the phones at this price.the pics just awesome you can enjoy them.>the 8 mp ultra wide camera is very good.>the clarity of 5 mp macro camera is very good compared to top end phones.>32 mp front face is so clear that your friends would be jealous of you during the video calls.talking about the display:->the screen is 6.4-inch(16.21 centimeters) Super Amoled - Infinity U Cut Display.>it supports colours over 16 millon.Gaming specs:->while playing the games like pubg ,COD and fortnite it is not the best .>The battery is so good that u could play upto 20 long pubg games in the phone.>You can download fortnite in this this by the help of samsung galaxy store.so it stil good for fortnite users.In this budget this is the best phone over all the phones.

Samsung M31 - A must buy mobile in less than 20K budget
",4,"

  I am using this phone from 7 days and in the seven days I have reviewed it and below are my observations:Unlock speed-Unlock speed using face recognition and fingerprint sensor is really super fast. you will not feel any lag while unlocking the phone it will open it up with just in fraction of a secondCamera -Having 64 MP camera in a budget of this phone is really unexpected you can click eye catching pictures using front and back camera the back camera has 4 sensors which allows you to click macros, depth , Wide Angle and normal pictures in high definition quality.the front camera which is 32 MP allows you to click steady pictures with wide angle for group selfies as wellBattery life and charging -Well, with the battery life I am not that much satisfied as I expected it to be. Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.Performance -Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.Overall summary -In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!

Good Budget phone

  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.

  Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung.  Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.

   I have been using galaxy M31 for about 2 months now.Pros:Battery life is really good.Display quality is excellent.Noise cancellation effect is good.Camera quality is suprb in daylight.Fingerprint reader is moderate.Face detection is good.Build quality is good. Once i dropped the phone and thought it would have damaged the screen, but nothing happened. Had it been my previous so claimed metallic Chinese phones it would have definitely caused a body dent and screen crack.Cons:Charging time is high.Night light pictures are not good.For ergonomic use phone would have been a little wider and shorter. This is my personal preference.Overall a gòod quality product from Samsung.

Great phone...... read whole honest review (after 2 months of purchase)
",1,"

  Fingerprint reader is good unless you have sweat on your fingers..... face lock is very accurate.The battery life is awesome and long lasting. It comes with McAfee antivirus preinstalled as inbuilt part of phone settings. The camera quality is somewhat controversial....... the quality of pictures clicked is very good.... the AI of camera is also nice ... only problem faced by me is it doesn't look like its 64 MP..... my mother has one plus 6 and it has 20 MP which I compared and found has equal zoom..... otherwise the quality of capture is far greater than even my sisters one plus 7. I recommend this phone and in this segment ..... samsung has just got everything boosted. The ram us also good..... I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem. The Dolby sound AI works really great and is only applicable when using earphones or headset. The inbuilt speaker is also loud and clear. The screen has very diverse, bright and clear display.Totally recommend it ...... I purchased is within a month of its arrival on Amazon

  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.

M31 over iPhone 7Plus
",5,"

  I purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol

  All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong  it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.

PHONE IS GOOD but experiencing some serious SCREEN GLITCH
",5,"

  The box wasnt tampered at all, received in good condition. Initially it worked great and works even now, but later found some pretty signifcant heating issues with the device, especially at the top area of the screen, near front camera. Don't know the reason. Also now since last two months I am experiencing some serious screen glicthes which is irritating me now. If you all want a phone of this range, well then i suggest you to put in 2 - 3 k more and buy M51 now.CAMERA works good, wide angle photos are also good, but some details are lost at the borders of the image, the image is automatically colour corrected after each click which is okay but sometimes gets a bit too much, stabilisation isn't really what you would actually like to expect, Just fine, for vloggers any stabilizer or monopod is a must. Selfie camera is also great so heyyaa all selfie geeks, have a good timePROCESSOR is also capable of performing various tasks at same time but I would prefer you to go with SnapDragon processors in the first place.DISPLAY is something Samsung never fails to meet our expectations. AMOLED screen is truly nice, colours are vivid.FINGERPRINT sensor in this mid range phone in my opinion is good. No issues with it, good timing and speed.OVERALL, ok product to be bought at this price but then M51 is  better version of it, so i would prefer you to go with it.

  I share some Tech Details.In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. Also it provide you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.In third Photo, You see Software Details.In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot(AI).Samsung M31 is good for gaming + work + Learning(like I learn Reverse Engineering, So need Video tutorials.. instead using pendrive i use my internal storage and super awesome, when your device comes with sAMOLED display.Battery backup is too good(6000 mAh), It something like (kab battery ktam hogi..) i use 52 hrs without puting on charging.Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.🤪😈

  Overall the phone quality is good ,but I got very much disappointed with the face recognition feature, the phone took plenty of time to unlock the phone. If the light condition in surrounding is good then it unlocks the phone other wise face could not be detected it says.

Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.

Best mobile under 20k
",4,"

  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.

Excellent phone
",4,"

  First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to high storage capacity, security functions and the quality of the camera. For me, the specs are as good I would expect from much more expensive phones. Another reason is that it is small enough to carry in a pocket. I'm not keen the large screen phones.

Great buy, highly recommended

  This is my first attempt with Samsung as my alternative phone number. I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.

No Samsung Pay, Exceptional battery life, light ergonomic phone, rapidly improving camera
",5,"

  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and ""reduce animations"" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table

  Pros:Amazing Screen QualityOne UISamsung branding and serviceMacro PhotographyCons:Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.

  Overall saying, Samsung M31 works goodPros1. Amazing camera2. Nice screen size and coverage3. Fingerprint sensor is good4. No heating issues5. Speed is quite amazing (you can quickly jump from one app to other, without worrying about hanging issues).6. Soft touch screen which I like mostCons1. Battery life is not as good as expected (you can pull off one day without charge if you spend 60% time of your work hours on phone)2. Face recognizer is extremely poor3. The phone is bit heavy as compared to others I have used so farIn overall terms, i will give 4.5 stars to M31 and I guess it will be a great phone for anyone who wants to try Samsung phone.

A good budget phone.

  I have been using this phone for over a month now. I need to charge once every two days, which is a major time saver. COnnectivity is good. I used to have connectivity issues with my previous phone, which was a big botheration. There are only areas that I have a bit of a concern. 1. the width of the phone is a bit narrow which, because of my thick fingers creates some typing challenges. 2. I wish the charging cable was 0.5 meter longer.Overall a good phone.

Best Made In India Mid Tier Smartphone.
",5,"

  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, ""budget smartphone"" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that's a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn't mind-blowing, it's great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you'd expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn't all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is ""okayish"". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it's a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I've been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.

  I purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:• The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.• The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.• The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.• As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.• And other functions of the phone starts properly.Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.

  Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.Signal reception has no problem.Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.Overall good product at this price. Go for it.

Awesome Mobile: Big battery & overall features are great

  Best thing about this Mobile is the BIG Battery & of course the Display is Top Notch.~ For Gaming also mobile fine, some say exynos is not that good vs Snapdragon chipsets but after using for 1st time i would say, not at all disappointed, because see if u can play Pubg in High settings and there not much heat then what else do you need, though there seems to be some lagging issue in higher settings for PUBG Graphics but basic & ultra settings works perfectly 👌.~ No issues with Sims (Airtel/ Jio)~ Best Display i have ever used (AMOLED)~ Sound quality also very good with speaker & also with earphones, atleast way better than my previous mobile (Moto X 4)~6000 Mah BATTERY ❤️ can't beat that with this price seriously 💯 easily works for whole day, on normal use u may get 30% on next day too,My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯)~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.~ Performance is also goodOverall i would definitely recommend this Mobile at this price range (i got this for 15,999)

Best everyday phone
",5,"

  I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.- sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.- Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.

  A big NO for gamers but simply awesome things are -1. of course the AMOLED Display.2. 6000mAh battery3. Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.

  Nice display and battery backup. Don't expect perfomance. Good for candy crush level games. Processor is old. At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily

  Unlike any other Samsung smartphone this smartphone is most value for money as it has many features while Samsung kept it's price within 20 k.Camera quality at this price is good. However it claims that it has 64 mega pixel what it does it it compile multiple shots to make it 64 mega pixel , let's not dive in technicality, it has good speaker sound, buy a cover as it is very slippery,  u will get only charger and mobile phone in the box.

Things to consider before purchasing M31
",5,"

  So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.

With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.

  It is the best phone in this range. I really got what I wanted in this price range. Camera is far better than any other phone in this range. Specially the 64mp back and 32mp back camera. There are lots of features in camera like slow mo, night mode, super slow mo and many more. Fingerprint is working very nicely. I searched many other phones in this range, I watched many videos and review on different platforms and I found that no other phone is better than this. Performance is also really. Battery(6000mh) is awesome. I charge my this phone only once in whole day. There are so many features in this phone. I like the dark mode of this phone very much. Display is also amazing.

  Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition

Slow Mo option is superb to add your own song in video.Hardware is good I do play sniper 3D and other shooting games without hesitation.

Wonderful Phone

  First of all let me tell you that previously I have used Nokia Lumia &  iPhone 6.I'm writing this review after 7 days of usage, using the 128GB version.Wonderful delivery experience by Amazon.Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.Camera Quality is awesome.Display is greatNo problem of overheating while usage or charging.Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

Best mid range phone
",4,"

  I am using this for more than 6 months. Samsung has really upgraded the software glitches those used to create UI slowness.Pros:1. Camera is best2. Lightweight even after having 6000mAH battery3. Fingerprint sensor is very quick4. Display has wide color range and quite bright5. No software lag6. Best for multitasking7. Blue light filter is really helpful8. The motion stability is pretty useful. It is quite fascination to see that it never feels like the video has ever been shot with the phone holdin in the hands.9. The camera captures images with natural colors, not with punchy color like some other phones do.Cons:1. In Macro mode it is hard to focus on object, but it is rarely used2. Night mode could have been a bit better with grain reduction and with more brightness

I picked the right one.

  I've had the phone for 22days now. The finger print reader is fast, no inconsistencies at all. It's better than some indispaly print readers.I like the screen, initially wanted the Galaxy A71 for its 6.7"" screen, but once I had this delivered I realised a 6.4"" screen was more than I needed.The battery lasts for about 18hrs, after which I am left with about 24-28% charge (after heavy usage).Which light usage  I have gotten well over 24hrs on a single charge.One thing I can tell you though, is to slap a sturdy case on the phone immediately after purchase.

Best Samsung Mobile Under 20k. Go for it during any deal. Best price for 128 gb is approx 16k.
",5,"

  Best device around 16k-17k. Overall 4.2/5.Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.Screen just superb. 4.7/5.Camera quality also nice. 4/5.Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.

  This device is best...super fast performance with oxygen OS. Super Amoled screen is awesome.you will enjoy watching video or browsing.Battery is awesome ..it gives 24 hours of battery backup with full usage once full charged otherwise with moderate usage it gives almost 2 days of battery backup.Charging is quite slow and it takes 3 hours to get fully charged but it is worth for usage of 24 to 36 hours. Camera is also superb with super video UHD recording. By default it comes with 32 Mpixel but user can change to 64Mpixel and click awesome pictures. MUST Buy if looking for stunning device in this particular budget. I have used almost for a week and then reviewing it.

Samsung never fails!

  I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!

Best non Chinese phone in this price range
",5,"

  I was certain that I will not be buying any Chinese product and unfortunately most of the products within my price range of 15 - 20K are Chinese phones. After doing loads of reviews I bought Samsung M31.Verdict: Build quality is great except the back could be a little harder, Camera quality is good but please do not get misled with 64MP quadra camera as it will make your expectation damn high. Overall wonderful pictures with good clarity but with lower configuration, my S9+ takes better pics. The sound quality is awesome. The screen is super awesome. Games played so far is only Roblox, CoC, and 8-ball pool and they ran perfectly without any lag. The battery ran for straight 2 days with a 100% charge with medium usages. Wifi Connectivity is very good but like any other Samsung phone, the phone network and the internet is a little slaggy. didn't find any heating issues so far. Overall I will definitely recommed everyone to buy this with closed eyes if you want to buy a Non Chinese phone at this price range as it is perfect.

  Firstly I was impressed by the delivery of the phone it was in my hand in just 10 hours after I book the phone in Amazon. Great job from Amazon.Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.

  6k battery is its usp.Not at all bulky considering it has a 6k batteryIt comes with latest android version 10 n Samsungs 1UI 2.0.Smooth performance. 128 gm memory is enough for an above average user same with 6gb ram.Nice camera with great options. Same with selfie camera. Pics in low light/night could be better but guess its a software thing that samsung would fix in the future updates.Would have loved a metal body and on screen fingerprint sensor but yes can't expect everything at this price. Fullyloaded mobile at this price and best thing is its made in India.

  Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.

BEST BUDGET PHONE TILL NOW
",5,"

  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.

M31 is best mobile
",5,"

  The Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It’s the processor choice for Samsung’s budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use.The Galaxy M30s had the new Exynos 9611 processor under the hood, a 48MP triple camera setup at the back, and a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that’s pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there’s a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn’t feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone’s liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ’64 megapixels’ mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phonesThe ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s’ ultra-wide camera. It’s useful to capture a wider scene, but don’t expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it’s great if you love taking close-up shots, though it’s often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots

Competitive Mega Monster

  A complete mega Monster.  This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged,  working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this,  I've been using A popular known brand and model,  Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming.  And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...

He says his laptop has a Ram of 8GB and this phone has 6GB of Ram and because of this huge Ram, the phone runs like makkhan ( Indian Butter).2. The camera quality is like awesome. He never used to click these many pictures before. It has special food button which is specialized to click pictures of food items. The night camera can make night look like day, ITS THAT GOOD.3. AR EMOTICON : Now this is something I like more. It can turn you into emoticons which is like very cool.4. Battery life : After the first day when he charged the phone to 100%, he only plugged the phone into the charger after like 2 days. The c-port charger is also like an add on.I find it a worthy investment :D

  The phone is really smooth in operating, it's amoled display does give you a feel of holding a premium phone in hand, it has 6000mAH battery, the phone is really handy, plastic body, but still very grippy, it is light and fits in your hands perfectly, and not like other phones like redmi 8 pro and so on which are much heavy and oversized, it is packed with exynos 9611 I was skeptic about this processor since I was into Snapdragon before, but yeah, the exynos does the work, and the main thing, for most of them buyers, playing games, tried PUBG on this phones, there are very little very very little frame drops, phone heats up sometimes, so I always play by taking off the cover, battery does a great job while playing PUBG, speaking about the camera, trust me, it is a camera of flagship level, I mean the clarity is so great for daytime conditions, haven't tried clicking anything at low light, since I didn't need one, main stuff, it also has 3.5 mm Jack and Dolby atmos support, so you can expect some great earphones experience, and I guess that covers it all.

  Worth the penny.Smooth UI. Good battery. Brilliant screen. Beautiful to look at and to hold in hand.But still few words to say.6000 ma battery should last two days unless UI consume huge power. The battery is excess for one day but not monstrous as described.Fast charger is enough fast only it to charge it three long hours.The camera quality is good in day light but could not understand why is it told 48 mega pixel. It's a gimmick. A good 13 mp is equivalent to the said 48 mega pixel. The camera fails to impress in low light photography just like other mobile phone camera.As a whole it's a good buy in the price tag of around Rs.13000.

M31 mega monster review after 4 days use
",5,"

   I am using this Megaphone from last 4 days. Here is review-1. As claimed the strongest part of this phone is Mega Battery and it's TRUE in every term. With moderate use throughout the day Battery was down to 80% only from full charged in morning. I watched movies for another 2 hours continuously reducing only 10% further to 70%. charging 1 hr was sufficient to get back to 100%. Totally Impressive!!2. Camera is phenomenal. Wide angle, super slomo video, hyperlapse, clicks with auto adjustment, night mode, zoom.. all are best in every term. I have attached few clicks & videos. Check out3. Very user friendly functions. Everything seems so simple. That's best part too.4. I used Samsung smart switch app to transfer my entire data from my old android phone to this one. Without any hiccups totally got that done in one go everything including messages, call records. Everything in matter of hour. Seamless experience.4. You can create your own emoji. Best part- you can use while using camera too!Overall totally happy with the purchase of this mobile.

  It's a  mega monster  at this price segment 🤖 I'll tell you the pros and consPros :➡️Super amoled display was so cool, you can't  find this kind of display on this price segment on another brand's....➡️ Camera is also so cool, I can't say it's a crystal clear  cam, but it's so cool on this price segment...➡️ It's too handy as well, with curvy edges  it's fit your hand so cool, you won't even feel it's 191 grams weigh....➡️Exynos 9611 (10nm) Chipset is good to  play high graphics games too....Games like pubg starts with high quality graphics on default,  Almost it's equal to Snapdragon 712 Chipset...➡️ It's doesn't matter that you are a heavy user,the 6000 mah will easily make it a day easily without any issues...➡️ Ear piece is good as well, no issues on receiving sounds...⚠️Cons...➡️  Macro cam mode is not that good as we expected....➡️ As so far, I can't find any more issues....Hope it'll help :)

  I have been using this phone for a while now ... And in lockdown situation this phone has given me good support.Fingerprint reader works fine and is located at back. But i am using the face recognition. I feel its better . I tried using my photos to unlock the phone .... No luck ... Works only with my face...Camera quality is good .... From a layman's perspective these are gr8 . From a photographer perspective they are just good. Depth camera gives good bokeh...Macro camera is goodBattery Life is just amazing ... I use this with all office communication apps and still get more than 2 days out of it ... Seriously i am just way toooo happy with it.Not happy with below:Phone is a little heavy because of monster batteryKnox is replaced with McAfeeI even tried some games like pubg and call of duty ... Seem to work fine for me ... So overall a monster (excellent) Phone

  The battery life is something which makes one remember the famous old advertisement which said ""Kya Karu Petrol Khatam hi nahi Hota"". It lasts long really long.Phone is super smooth with no lags. The display is very bright and the sound quality is awesome too.The camera is one of the best in the class and probably much better than anything available in this range. Please note that you have to change a few things in the settings to be able to use the camera in a better way. The default camera mode is controlled to conserve memory.The only annoying thing is that few apps are automatically installed with software updates.And, then you have to take the extra effort to locate it and remove it.

A Great Buy
",5,"

  The Samsung M31 is a power packed performer not only among it's equivalent price range smartphones but comparative to all high end phones available in the market today.1. Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.

  The phone works great.Display:Most amazing display anyone can ever get in this price range. This phone's display is better than any phone in this proce range. Movie watching experience is truly amazing on this phone.Camera:All 4 cameras have different purpose and works fine. Camera quality is great and zoomed photos are very clear too. The display of the phone helps the camera to display it's clicked photos even better. Although i found a big issue that camera isn't able to focus at small objects placed near to it. It maybe a software problem which i am hoping would be resplved with the next update.Interface:The new Samsung interface is better than its previous ones. This is way more friendly and easier to use.GPU:A very strong processor is provided by Samsung in this phone. None of the games lag and works perfectly fine.

  After using an iphone this phone feels quite low in performance. The screen resolution is not sharp, the camera has filters but images are not sharp. A bit slow response to certain apps.Otherwise good with fingerprint response, battery life is amazing overall for the price it's good for general use.

  Lovely phone. The amazing battery life and the vivid, bright screen more than make up for some apparent shortcomings. Another interesting feature is a macro camera.. the wide angle camera is very good too. The basic camera has excellent low light capability and gives a bright image (is it the screen or the camera?).. in short the camera(s) perform much better than expected.And the phone feels solid.The battery again is just great. What's the point having lots of features and not being able to use them? The battery makes them available and reliable. I think this is the first smartphone around with acceptable battery life. For a 15K phone (introductory price), this is real good! Great job Samsung. And nice delivery Amazon, I received it the day before the lock down!

  Samsung Galaxy M31 is the Perfect package out there. The Mega 6000mah battery easily gives me 2 days of battery backup. The 64mp camera gives amazing details in the photos. And the best part is, you can also take macro shots, not just with the macro lens, but with the help of 64MP camera too.I was looking for few of things from my new phone. I wanted a great camera, great battery backup, unique and elegant looking design on the back of the phone. Samsung Galaxy M31 provides all of it. Plus a Super-AMOLED display. Samsung is THE best display manufacturer out there. The exynos chipset is no less than any other chipset in the market.This phone has made me decide that my future phones will be of Samsung.

Exceptional battery and superfast fingerprint reader

  Great phone.Great camera, superfast fingerprint, excellent display, best battery.I was using A70 before this which costs 50% more than this phone and I can surely say m31 is much better in everything. No difference in speed,  much much better battery life, great fingerprint (which ofcourse is better than screen fingerprint of A70).Everything about this phone feels better as compared to A70.

  There's hardly anything that i dont like about this smartphone. Brilliant  performance, brilliant battery life, amazing camera, brilliant overall.1. The screen.sAMOLED display  is on point, super clear & very well user friendly.2. The camera.Stunning. 64mp does the job the way it's supposed to. Front 32mp camrea is also very impressive. In the rear, quad camera setup is impressive. The sample images are a few example of the camera quality. Also the wide angle lens is a rather wonderful function.3. The battery.Probably the biggest highlight of this smartphone is the battery. A MASSIVE 6000mAh battery can easily go on throughout the day with enough battery life left for the next day. For an average user, the battery will easily live upto 2 days. Heavy usage? It will still go on for a day. Even when the battery is about 15 to 20% the performance doesnt show any decline. The only thing i found a bit not so good about the phone is the charger. M31 comes with a 15W charger which will take atleastaround 2.3 hrs to charge fully. But the new M31s fixes the problem, it comes with a 25W charger & the same 6000mAh battery promising shorter charging time.4. Built quality & design.Front and rear looks impressive. Has a very modern yet conservative designs. Doesn't feel that heavy while holding and is also a perfect fit in the pocket.The blue colour looks beautiful but the one i have is a black one. Yes, the black looks cooler but since the rear is made up of plastic with a glossy finish, it can very easily attaract scratches and fingerprints,  so I'd suggestanyone to use it with a mobile cover.5. Verdict.Overall the smartphone is an impressive package. It simply proves that spending over 50k on a smartphone is insane. Some complain about the processor that is Exynos 9611 which is in my point of view nothing to be worried about. Every function runs smooth and easy thanks to the processor and 6gb RAM, touchscreen is also very responsive,  also the power button can be used to open apps as a shortcut. With 128gb space, dual sim support, 6gb ram, a great battery life, sAmoled display, this phone has everything that it takes to be a flagship phone competitor as a considerable margin. Its almost been more than 2 months since im using this phone and so far i haven't faced any problems with the device any hopefully will not face any in the coming future. The surprising thing is that with all the power packed in the box, it still manages to fit under 20k category which makes it incredibly appealing. I'd surely suggest if anyone is looking to buy one!

An excellent purchase for the price offered
",5,"

  Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smoothBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expectScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decentCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp camProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.

Excellent

  Excellent product. Worth buying it.Pros:Massive 6k battery. Goes on and on.4 rear cameras with the main one at 64mp.Excellent front cam.Blue color looks stunning.S amoled screen with always on display.Finger print and face unlock work superb.Android 10.Cons:Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.Suggestions:Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.Never look at M30 or M30s. You get M31 for the same price with much better camera.

  Samsung galaxy m31 is great. I like its battery.Display is also cool. No lag when you are opening many applications same time. I have used it for many days now. Takes 2 hour to full the battery from zero which is less. Fast 15 w charger. If you are going for 6gb ram 128 gb I would prefer go for it. Talking camera i was amazed to see wide photos with high clarity. Selfie too has added advantages. Thanks samsung for making a high end mobile at this affordable price. Also samsung is made in india. So people go for local.

  Cons:1). The biggest drawback after discharge is, It gets fully charged in 2.5 to 3 hrs, so irritating.

  Display is fabulous as it is Super Amoled display, no pointing discussing about it. Now fingerprintscanner is pretty hippy, so full Mark's. BEST part is the battery last almost two days plus for me, I am not a gamer but social media bug, watch Prime YouTube and More.With all this I am not going with exynos processors capability as I have not put it to test.CAMERA is good but what disappoints is 64MP setting is only in 4:3 not fullscreen and Pro version has no aperture and shutter control, my wife's one and half year old Huawei mobile has that, seriously Samsung if I r going to compete with Redmi note 9  and realme 6 I got to up the ante a bit more ...

  This phone is the best phone which we can buy currently especially when this is coming from a brand like Samsung1. The first thing is the screen which is very crisp and clear. Love watching movies on it.2. The processor is fast and one of the best in this price range.3. The battery which is 6000 mah even with a heavy phone usage will easily last you through the day and even more.4. The finger print reader works well.5. The camera is really good with great output all around.All in all, it ticks all the right boxes and you are guaranteed to enjoy this phone. A very easy recommendation for all.

  You've already got the reviews but here I am reviewing as a gamer only about a few things.# Battery is OK if you use only for calling or internet surfing but drains rapidly as you play games for few hours.# Heating issue on the upper part (back + front side) of the phone especially when you play games.# Its charging cable is too short even not completely 1 meter.# It says fast charging but it doesn't look like there's such system it has. Because it took more 2 hours to complete charging.# It's auto brightness feature not working properly.# With Pubg type games, I'm having a slightly display resolution problem on its edge but only with selective games app.PROS you know very well so, I'm not gonna mention. Rest qualities or features are same as company mentioned.BUT do something with this HEATING issue even happens during charging whether you use it or not.##Overall not bad for gaming.

Battery and Design

  After using Samsung Note 3 for a good time, I shifted to M31. The huge battery has been a big relief for me and from the battery drain tension when going on a long trip. I don't use it for gaming so typically I have to charge twice in three days. You may need to keep for a long time for it to charge fully.  The screen display is sharp and clear.The build is good. It fell a couple of times from bed but the curved edges on the sides have prevented it from getting scratches. I don't like putting case or screen protector as it increases the weight and reduces the aesthetics. Also, don't put keys in the same pocket as it can give permanent marks on the glass. The black backside is a finger magnet and it will take some time for you to get used to it.I have given five stars also because of customer care which takes your error reports seriously.

Great specs and features but finger print scanner and frequent freeze (hang) are letdown
",4,"

  This phone is fully packed with features and specs that I don't need to mention. What you need to know is it's UI is great but on the cost of processor and finger print. It's been almost 2 months and it has started to hang and sometimes to the extent where I have to restart the phone. And talking about finger print scanner it's worthless man because it most of the time doesn't detect it (if you have sweating finger even a bit of it) or delayed detection. Apart from that it's a great phone but these 2 cons are a major one so won't recommend it.

Camera quality I found very good,  though professional reviewers mentioned low on low light, I found it otherwise, as it takes good pictures without any issues focus is not lost, flash is powerful enough to take those pics in absolute dark.I recommend anyone to buy the phone just closing their eyes. For price tag of 17K it is simply awesome no need to invest 25k, 35k for smartphone as it gives more features for the price of 17K

Great value for money

  I purchased this product for a family member and was surprised by the quality of the phone. The blue color is amazing and the performance is adequate for regular use. I am not high on gaming and media on phones and hence this is more than adequate for someone looking to primarily use a phone for browsing and other productive work apart from calls and texts.The Samsung interface is not very intuitive but it works. The display is clear and bright and the scrolling is smooth. Feels premium to hold and behaves like one.

  Iam always been big fan of samsung display and camera and ever since I had used them I haven't thought ant going 4 other chinese brands with cheap LCD display on which u can neither appreciate a good pic nor game or enjoy movies on it!!6.4"" Full hd Amoled screen + 64 mp/32 mp camera + 6000 mah battery wd fast charging was too much to ignore even when MI & realme were giving very competent specs at lower price but it's lcd display & camera was not 4 me hence I went for M31  and it outperformed my expectations!!From phone display to camera quality to battery life to processor it was just perfect for me in 15K..I wud hv appreciated a gradient glossy panel but ocean blue color is actually very beautiful and shiny and phone doesn't feel heavy at all!!Battery is huge and for full charging it does take time but it can easily last a day on 50℅ charge for normal usage so iam not worried abt battery life and 15w charger  !!6 GB ram is the most impressive feature of this phone,thank u samsung.64 MP rear camera and 32 mp front were treat to click , u don't need any 3rd party app to adjust/beautify ur clicks such gr8 has been camera quality of M31!!Slow motion recording both front and back was the feature I was looking forward to and I loved it!!Iam not a heavy gamer but this phone can play pubg ,asphalt, mortal kombat and other heavy games wd ease!!Finger print reader works well this time in samsung M31 !Few tips and tricks:By def front camera is 21 MP in order to select 32 MP option select wide-angle option and then select 3:4 full option and u will see camera size 32 mp.For rear camera 64 mp option is available in options u hv to just look into itSlow motion is available in both front and back camera but super slow motion is available in rear camera only! Loved that feature!Only downside I found was knox security not present but u can always install a good antivirus to keep ur m31 safe!!McAfee is there anyway to keep u safe!!No complaints only praise for this beautiful and affordable monster, if ur planning to upgrade ur fone wd impressive quad camera , beautiful display and huge battery M31 will not disappoint u, it is d best phone in terms of camera, battery, display and with 6gb ram and xynos latest processor it can easily do multitasking and gaming wd ease.. I loved it,it works like a charm

Samsung M31 6GB + 128GB
",5,"

  This is an amazing product.Battery Life - with a proper usage with a couple of hours of gaming, calls, internet usage, videos, etc, the battery works well for one and half days. It works even better if in the night one puts it on battery saver mode.Build - The phone build looks rugged. Its back is very smooth so feels like it will slip off the hand. The thickness is slightly more but its a compromise for the large battery it holds.Camera - the output is really good and crisp. Photo quality and videos quality is nice.Sound - The phone has one speaker, but sound quality is really decent.Cards - it has dedicated slots for 2 SIMs and a memory card. But with 128GB one would not need much !I have eventually bought 4 of these for within the family and noticed some build issue. On the back camera, I observed that camera slot should be slightly out of the body. But when I checked one phone, I saw that the level was merged with the back cover. That is a concern for me. With this, I actually noticed the same on the other phones and realised that the back cover needs to be pressed a little to allow the camera slot to pop out.Now I am afraid that this could be manufacturing defect.I also had a passing comment from one of the amazon delivery guys that the phone is the most commonly returned phones these days. But thankfully it is not for us for the moment.

  Good phone overall.Camera looks good. (Coming from a OnePlus 5)Built is good.Massive 6k mAh battery!Charging time with included charger, was ~3hrs for charging from 3% to 100%. However given that battery is almost double of other phones, it's okay.Worth it!Deducted 1 star because of the number of stupid bloatware it had ! Most of them could be uninstalled, but some could only be disabled!

  Everything is better than expected. Just one thing can't resolve: JioCall app doesn't work. Though jio internet works, calls also are ok. Only app itself is not ok. I tried to check sim setting, mobile data settings, to restart the phone, everything - but nothing helps. Maybe there's no need of this app actually as soon as everything works without so it's ok.

  Battery: If one uses it like just a phone, you can get upto 4 days of battery. However, I get 3 days of battery because of my bluetooth usage.5/5.Screen: I haven't seen such bright and colour accurate screen ever! People who require a lot of videos and movies, just go for it.5/5.Face detect: Not so good. 3/5.Fingerprint scanner: I would say it gets the job done however, a little more speed and accuracy would have been better. 4/5.

Samsung galaxy m31 is awesome though there was a hickup at software update
",5,"

  I am updating my old review because Samsung has provided excellent service via email to troubleshoot my galaxy M31 download struck issue, the mobile is performed well as of now, it is an excellent mobile because I am surprised when others are provided good feedback on my video call, the pics are also awesome, I have taken my little daughter's pic which was my favourite photo ever with this awesome Galaxy M31 mobile.If you want to know about my previous problem here it is, but Samsung solved it remotely without visiting the service center.:Galaxy M31 stuck at 'Downloading...Do not turn off target', ODIN MODE (AVB Fail)SUPER: Build-id does not match with the reference(SUPER) : 30278215R, (BOOTLOADER) : 29256088I have tried to restart using Volume down+power button then samsung logo comes and then immediately it shows Downloading... blue screen. Tried many times but no use at all, My daily work is purely depending on this mobile but due to this problem I cannot use this mobile at all now, this will make my days too dangerous about my job during this corona lock down,  so contacted  samsungchat assistant but they suggested to visit the service center, but due corona lock down no service center available, I do not understand why should I visit the service center because it is a software problem not the hardware problem, I have tried to search the issue in Google it seems most of the Galaxy M31 mobiles facing the same issue, so I suggest samsung people should look into this issue ASAP and resolve it automatically without visiting the service centre by force update some thing

  Messages can be categorized. Charging status  can be monitored in off screen mode also which is illuminated in a small icon while charging. Charge last for 36 hours for a moderate user like me. The home screen may be turned automatically into monochrome mode during our desired night hours . For each app timer can be set which may prevent us to limit our exposure to mobile phone. Memory can be optimised with smart optimised with a touch of a button. When compared to my previous L G k10 which I purchased for this same price 3 years ago, it is far better . Camera quality  is outstanding. Since the Mobile is loaded  with 6GB Ram which promotes the response speed. 128 GB internal memory is a plus point. No lagging  and heating  problem sofar since my usage from 7.9.2020. Amazon shoppers have done a great job. Mobile has arrived safely. Overall this Mobile is worth the money we are paying for

  The battery is the best part of the mobile. It really lasts long. You can easily play PUBG for an hour and the battery will be reduced to maximum 15 percent. The touch response and display is fantastic !! The s-amoled  display is really vibrant. The display feels really premium and better than high end premium phone. I have honor 10 which is 35K, compared to which this display and performance is better . I prefer using this more than my Honor 10.

  Got it delivered in just 2 days! Big thumbs up to Amazon for prompt delivery 😁Have been using this since 2-3 days now.It's a decent device for the given price range.Bought Samsung as I had decided not to go for any Chinese brands and I have no regrets! Works smoothly.. Camera app has a lot of modes, takes some time to get used to it.Hyperlapse mode is superb!I have recorded videos for youtube..loved the inbuilt mic audio quality!Totally loved the video stabilization!I was able to get decent macro shots!Clicked pictures look natural & colorful.Can't wait to explore other modes of camera!Chinese applications like Helo, Tik Tok are preinstalled..a little disappointing.The camera quality could've been better...Pictures were pixelated...changed the quality of capturing images..got decent results...later I installed Google cam, works perfectly...enables to click crisp pictures.The USB cable is small and it's a bit annoying.Thinking of getting a fast charger as the one provided with device is just 15WBack cover is not provided in the box.Bought Samsung (it's mentioned that this device has been manufactured in India) as I had decided not to go for any Chinese brands and I have no regrets! Apart from these few cons, the device is really good for the given price! I'd suggest everyone to get this device rather than going for some other Chinese Brands!

Review of SAMSUNG M31 after using it for 4 days..
",5,"

  I am writing this review after using this phone for 4day.This is a best budget phone in the range of 15000 as whatever u want  all the things are inside this phone, if u compare this phone  With One plus 7T  Then in camera and battery backup  this phone get a Superb value. I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.I want to explain it's some feature as below1stly Battery 5star2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.3rd Front camera - 4star.4th Processor - 4star5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4starThese all ratings are out of 5.Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.Overall , If  someone  want to buy A phone @15000, And also  He/she is  interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone  want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she  may avoid ,  as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..

Very good phone. J recommend this phone but before please read reviews

  For any smartphone battery life is most important. Battery normally  last generally almost 2 days after moderate to high uses. Fingerprint reader work well. Display is very attractive, cool and good for eyes while using this phone in night. It is very good while seeing movies in prime, YouTube etc. Phone is very lightweight for carrying in pocket. Phone is not hanging during as Samsung  previous phone had this issue. Some people complained about heating issue during long call or heavy uses. As I am not a very heavy phone user still I have found no issue about heating . While some heating issue was observe during charging but it's very common. No heating issue observed while calling. Sound quality is good but not loud as generally  observed for other Chinese smartphone. Memory is 6 GB ram and 128 GB internal memory. But most bloatware apps are given in this smartphone. But memory is enough for those whom which like installing  gaming app or heavy application. Camera quality is very awesome. Selfi camera is very  good and main camera works good in light and dark as well. Flashlights  provides for both front and rear cameras. Images taken from this phone are attached.

  Very nice phone at this price range from Samsung. Really amazing...Just some minor issues: it doesn't have Knox security, its plastic back can easily invite scratches, Samsung could have improved the charging quality and its processor too and it doesn't have a screen recording feature or link to windows feature. The 32mp front camera is not good as good as expected it gives you the quality of a 15 to 20mp camera.It really has a super battery life, very nice rear quad camera with plenty of new features, amazing display, the fingerprint sensor and the face unlock is superfast and it gives you a nice performance.Hope you find this helpful.

A Great Value For Money Product

  This phone has an excellent display, which is good to look at even outdoors when the sun is shining brightly. The display quality makes it an excellent multimedia phone too. The signal reception and call quality are pretty good. The speakerphone does the job. The best part about the device is its battery life. It lasts a day even with close to heavy use, involving much web browsing, a lot of movie viewing, and listening to many audio files. The device has a great camera for its price. I am not that interested in camera, but my shutterbug friends told me that the pictures taken through it are good. Another valuable feature is Dolby Atmos, which improves the sound output quality of the Bluetooth speaker connected to it.I do not have any flaws to say regarding the device. A slight quibble is that the back panel catches fingerprints quite easily, but using a back case solves it.

  The look is very attractive.The touch is very smooth and sensitive. Works really fine. Fingerprint is fast enough. Even with little moist finger, it works really fine.Face recognition is amazing. Fast. Even in a bit darker room, its able to recognize if you bring your phone a little closer.Battery is 6000 mah. With full 100 percent charge, It will easily work fine upto 2 days. Given that you're not using much wifi and data.Camera quantity is good but not that great.The main camera is 64mp. But when you zoom in the pic, sometimes the pixels get distorted.The wide angle camera is amazing. Although it's just 8mp, but the picture quality is really amazing. Captures 123 degrees wide.Macro and Depth Camera is 5mp. The picture quality and pixel is great. The focus on the main about is really good.Video quality is amazing. Even when you're walking or driving, the video is quite stable. So really love the video stabilization.Slow motion works really fine. Only thing is in the normal video the brightness is a bit more. But in the slow motion, the video is a little bit dull.But overall the camera is really great.For the price, it's a great phone. Worth your money.

I have received my phone on 8th March ,ordered on 5th march when the sell has started.when I took this in my hand ,feel very light weight if comparision to 6000mah mega battery, I watched a movie of 2hour and 5 mins and it consumed only 20% battery ,battery life is very great ,it runs approx 1 to 1and half day after full charge. Charging time is approx 140 minutes.Its camera quality is outstanding , night mode is also hats off, macro camera is so pretty if compare to other brands,It is completely one handed phone. so many features are available in this phone.It has a very very very smooth processor. Now if talking about display that what a display is it. M31 has Curved display like which is given on samsung S8, S9 OR S10. It feels like premium display, Dark mode is outstanding..I always use dark mode.Rear fingerprint is also working properly. It has a great quad camera set up. Worth for money...

A very VFM MidRanger
",5,"

  My previous phone had a cracked LCD and was on the lookout for a new phone. Thanks to the lockdown, had lots of time on my hand to review most phones, get firsthand accounts from friends and then make a choice.To be honest, my first preference was the OP8 and was looking for video reviews when I stumbled upon this phone. Samsung seems to have packaged a decent bit of hardware and specifications on this phone which gets most of your job done.Disclaimer: If you are an avid gamer, then this is not for you unless you are ready to make trade offsWhat I Like the most:1. Comes with Android one UI v2. The phone has a near bloat free experience and very close to stock android. However, some of the features are masked by Samsung, I'm if those will be available in higher end or flagship models like S20 / S20 Note etc. However, loving the features like Dark mode, use Camera flash for notification, ability to capture more than one face etc.2. Amazing display, the AmOLED display is a pleasure to view and even can be used under direct sunlight.3. The phone comes with support for two sims and SD card, which is good for avid music lovers like me to stash and carry my ever-growing collection of music & videos.4. Samsung switch App, for once I have a product from Samsung which does the job without any fuzz. Was able to transfer my data from my broken phone using this.5. The Camera is of decent quality, so far, the pictures have turned out well, but still exploring so will reserve my comments for now.What I don’t like1. 6000 MAH battery adds to the weight but gives the same performance as my old phone 4000 MAH battery. Could have tweaked battery usage2. The build is dated, and the naked phone may not draw any oohs & aahs from onlookers. Plastic body is prone to scratches and fingerprints, so better invest in a case.3. No headphones provided by Samsung, not sure if this is the trend, but a simple 100 Rs earphone could have enhanced the VFM perspective.4. Lastly the Exynos processor, so far, I’ve not notices any lag or slowness, but at times I feel that the phone is a tad unresponsive especially when I try to pull down the notification panel or try to dismiss a few apps.Overall Verdict:It’s a bargain buy with good specifications, recommend purchasing this.

  Why people are going to Chinese products, just because of unable to find good products from other countries within budgetJust because to ignore Chinese products I have purchased this Samsung Galaxy m31 but not a good mobilePros:1. Battery backup (con is 3hours charging time)2. Dual sim with memory card (my favorite option)Cons:1. No full screen videos in YouTube, games,etc2. No proper gestures3. Fingerprint sensor not accurate4. Difficult to find required options5. No removable battery (if it's hung we can remove and fix the issue)6. No headphones (marketing separately from all companies)7. Not provided temporary case also( most of the Chinese companies will provide)8. Updating OS will heat mobile with very high temperatureThese are the pros and cons found in 20 days

  Now firstly for the pubg lovers I would like to tell you that it easily runs pubg at HDR ultra settings of graphics with no lag you just need to activate performance mode which obviously uses more battery give best performance.The phone has three battery modes by default it will be in performance mode ,( takes as much juice possible from your battery to handle your heavy tasks, multitasking, etc. And once you it last easily 2 days. Cameras are awesome it's a bit warmer and soft images but details are amazing and other colours.....Guys literally there are loads of features and don't want to write an essay over here it will be tedious for you all to read....Trust me I'm using it as my daily driver and had no issues ya it may not have 90Hzs but who needs it in day to day budget life.

My favorite is this Super AMOLED screen just 😘.Pros-superb battery. 1- 1.5 dayCamera (Rear camera is on other level) + AR Emoji6 GB Ram (more than my laptop)Very nice call quality (I uses Airtel)Finger print sensor is fast.Selfie is better in natural lightingDedicated Memory card slot.Charging speed is not that slow.Feels very nice in hand and can be easily hold in one hand.Cons-Face unlock is slowww and few times didn't worked.Can't uninstall Netflix, Facebook and few other Samsung's app but these can be disabled.Got around 50 GB out of 64 GB.No back cover provided in box.Finger prints are all over the back.VerdictBest phone to buy around this budget. Super value for money. I am very happy to have this phone.Don't think just buy it. You won't regret.

Samsung should consider improving it's charging speed.
",5,"

  I have been using it for last 3days. All things are good  but it is taking more than 4hrs for charging. I don't know whether it's a defective one or is the  characteristic of Samsung m31. Whatever  but more than 4hrs of charging time is unacceptable.  I am observing it for another day if it goes like this than I will return it.After day 5 of my use; it is doing well. It's charging within 3hrs, though it's not fast charging but ok for me. The day 1 sluggish charging may be due to first time charging of the phone in use. Now it is performing well. If you want a phone with good battery back up and best screen quality then you can go for it.

Great display with average camera
",1,"

  Great display for the price range and I am happy that I shifted to Samsung for this reason.Battery life is good and lasts for almost 2 days with normal usage with WiFi, but it's not the best as it drains quickly with 4G.Camera is decent when it's outdoor. At low light and indoors it's just an average camera. Live focus selfies and night mode(front and rear)are useless. Live focus / portrait blurs out some portion of the face which is very bad.Call quality and speaker quality is fine.Samsung One UI is good but it misses out some of the important features as it's M series phone.

Superb Phone! Superb Camera quality! Ease of access!

  Galaxy M31 is an awesome phone. The camera quality is superb. The phone has ease of access. Touch sensor is amazingly smooth. Since I was using some Chinese phone earlier, I could easily make out the difference. All the apps have country of origin mentioned in it (not sure if other phones have it, my earlier one didnt have it) Although I am not so tech savy, but found this phone one of the best phones till date with affordability (got a hot deal for old phone exchange as well🤩). All and all a recommended phone who are looking for a budget deal 🙂

  .I have been using this Samsung Galaxy M31 for 3 months now.Here is what I like about this phone-I am quite satisfied with it's 48 MP Triple Camera that delivers quite beautiful picture quality, Other than that I am happy with the long lasting battery, fast charging, smooth touch response and the clarity of super amoled display. Other good thing about the phone is that it does not heat up even after a long time of game play both online and offline.But ...I am not satisfied with the functioning problem of the phone that quite an often the phone hangs when I am typing something and some other times it get re-started on its own.& apart from its functioning it does not come with free customisation of themes and icons as everything is paid.Overall Phone is good.

Powerful mobile within Budget with lots of Battery juice to run all day long

  Perfect mix of hardware and software to perform not just daily tasks with ease but also performance heavy tasks with ease. The display is beautiful and bright inside and easily visible under the sun also. The camera is one of the best in its category with a quad camera configurable with pixel density upto 64 megapixel. The OneUI from Samsung is intuitive, responsive and convenient to use. Best is that the device is 'Made in India' :) ... a highly recommended phone. The only con is the front camera could have been a 'pin-hole' form factor but then one easily gets used to the 'U-cut' camera form-factor in a matter of a few days.Overall a must have device and highly recommended on all fronts - good camera / display / processing / battery / looks.

  Hi all samsung fans,Galaxy M31 is wonderful phone overall. The main pros of this phone is camera and display. I  should say about the one UI also, its a wonderful work by Samsung. Lots of customization is available in One UI. Quad cam is awesome. For pubg I can play in high refresh rate and UHD graphics.Their are few drawbacks too...6000 Mah battery doesn't show the perfomance as it says, but its decent...Phone has a slight heat issue, only on heavy usage.Overall Samsung Galaxy M31 is a supercool phone that you can have in this price rage.Note to samsung:1. Please add secure folder in next update.2. Provide a built in app lock.

I don't play mobile games so I won't be able to comment on its gaming performance but it's perfect for everyday usage.Battery 10/10.Camera 9/10.It does have some heating issues but I guess it's the same with every budget smartphone out there.

  Software isn't  as sturdy as needed, seems slower at most of the times.Camera is good, but not as good as claimed. Even 6/10 as claimed.Battery charges fast enough and gives good back up.Fingerprint sensor is ok only, while as face recognition isn't even ok.Overnight downloading stops by itself and you need to manually turn on/off the data to keep up the downloading. Checked all the settings but the issue persists.I guess, Phone's software needs some sort of upgrade and the phone will be perfect among all other phones of under 20k range.

The best smartphone you can get in this price range
",5,"

  There are several pros for M31. But since it's already covered by other reviewers and YouTube videos, I'll instead point out some not-so-common cons (if at all you can call them cons!)1. The phone does not come with a backcover and it is a fingerprint magnet. So you would need to buy a backcover for aesthetics.2. Not water resistant (is that asking too much?😅)3. It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top. Again, it wouldn't be a bother if you use a Bluetooth earphone/headset. :)5. This might not be the phone for heavy gamers.I haven't found any other problem after a month's usage.Overall, I totally recommend this phone. 😊P.S - I saw some reviews saying the camera quality is poor. I disagree to it as I feel it's really good.

My kids use this phone for online classes for almost 4 hours even it requires only 2 days once charging.  Kudos Samsung.  Apps performance is very good.

  After using almost 50 days , First let me tell about the seller, I have read a lot of negative reviews and even I was scared that whether I'll receive a genuine productor not. They even took 6 days to deliver but ""it was better late than never"" and I received a Awesome product.Coming to the device, it's the best that Samsung could provide with all these features for this price range (almost a flagship kind of feel).Processor - at first I felt that it was bit slow, but after a use of a day or two, I could realize that it was learning your daily usage pattern and it delivers a smooth performance.Camera - best quality images from all the cameras in good lighting conditionFingerprint sensor - if you think it as slow, you're wrong, it's just very accurateBattery - you can survive more than a day with normal usageDisplay - I'm a fan; crisp display and the punch hole camera doesn't interfere with your entertainment, you almost feel it as invisibleOverall it's an Awesome device; You'll have a great feel with this device

Overall Good Phone, Front Camera quality Not good Enough
",5,"

  Device is overall good, But I must say that camera quality is not upto the level I was expecting it being a 64MP camera phone.Front camera photography is a not good in dark and images appear very grainy. Talking about image processing Colors are oversaturated and during video calls you could see a yellow tint. This underperformance of the front camera is because of the notch design as there is less space in the front for another camera/ flash.The rear camera is somewhat good in photography and and the videography is pretty good.BloatwaresWith this phone Samsung has targeted the  budget phone section as they were falling behind the likes of other Chinese manufacturers. Though they have packed this phone with massive features but it comes with  a trade off i.e. Bloatwares and sponsored app downloads. If you are wise enough to bypass those app promotions you can happily use this phone.Overall, I am satisfied with the phone because I didn't want to go for Chinese companies. But still I miss Good front camera.

  I was looking for a non Chinese phone. I wasn't left with much options. However, it's not bad either.Who can buy this and why:Best Screen at this price: Amoled screen is out of the wold. Who love watching videos/movie specially while on the goCamera: camera is one of the best ( not as best as oppo or vivo) But, definitely better than redmi. Macro is better than any othe phone.Battery:  Who has long usage. Fetches 2days battery life easily. ( But not suitable for hardcore gamers )UI: very light and we'll managed. Good in long run ( But not as good as funtouch). No lags at allSpeakers are fairly good. But not too loud.Samsung brand value, service and resell values are very goodUpdates are assured.Finger print sensor is pretty fastData safety is the key reason why one needs to buy this phone.Cons: face unlock is little slowSlightly heavier but, considering battery size it's nothingPrice is slightly higher than it is supposed to be. But screen quality will make forget it.

  What I am impressed is the camera quality in night time. The  battery life is long enough to keep you occupied for the  whole day. Now the charging speed is not best in class but its fast. I loved upgrading from my old phone. Moreover Amazon allowed me to exchange my old phone that brought the price of the phone in my budget. Thanks.Many customizable features for dark mode, blue light, game recording etc are best.On the downside. You will feel lack of snapdragon processor during heavy gaming. Otherwise I would have given 5 star.

I've never been this satisfied with a phone's performance at this price range.It is absolutely amazing in all aspects from camera to battery. Performance is smooth.

  Honestly didn't expect this phone to be soo good. The software animations are so fluid, the camera is crazy good and the screen is obviously best in the market coz. Its Samsung's. I'm listing some pros and cons down here, be sure to read it. Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.Pros:•Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.•The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.•6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.•The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.•The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.•Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.•Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.Cons. :•No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.•In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).•phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.•The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.

M31 - Better than other same price segment phones
",5,"

  I would say this is a better phone as compare to Redmi note 9 pro max. The reason is very subjective but I will try to answer few of them.The first and foremost is the premium look and feel of this phone which is unlike the Redmi note 9 pro max. The next is the camera quality it’s really outperform as compare to anything which rate me as to offer. Next the overall hamlet screen over here is much better as compare to redmi note 9 pro max.Lastly it all depends on how much you have to spend on a given phone but having a Samsung phone can always give you assurance that it will last long at least an year or two more as compare to any other brand.

Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night.

  Review after 4 days usage:The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.Pros:1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah3. Display is crisp and very sensitive4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.Cons:1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung

  Beautiful screen with vibrant colours and a wonderful battery life is all I needed and Samsung galaxy delivers it to the dot. No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery. And the screen is brilliant with popping colours and eligible under sun.The blacks are deep as it should be on an amoled. Decent gaming is welcome. And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.

5* but comes with some compromises
",5,"

  Remember:* Galaxy M series phones don't have Knox security, so you won't get features like Secure folder, Samsung Pass, Samsung Pay, and other Knox-dependent services.* Galaxy M series phones run One UI 'Core', so features like Good Lock, Bixby are not compatible.* Samsung phones generally struggle in network reception in areas where coverage is poor. If there's strong network coverage, then you won't notice any difference.Otherwise, it's a decent phone for at around 15k.

  This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.My smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.From Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.Following is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.Good: (for M31)- Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.- Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.- Both the SIM support 4G (that’s plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.- Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.- Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.- Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.- Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn’t response. That’s problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.- Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.Not So Good: (for M31)- Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.- Doesn’t come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.- To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.- SMS can’t be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that’s important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.- Mobile torch can’t be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-- No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn’t get disturbed. Now, little used to it.- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.If you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can’t match Samsung. I have been user of

  This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varientPros:1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.Cons:1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.

  Alert: This will be very common man review not a technical one so if you are looking for technical review kindly skip it.Samsung M 31 has been great buy owing to its monster battery  life. I am a new mom and purchased this mobile  when my infant was 2 months  old. The battery lasts pretty long even after playing multiple YouTube videos and being on long video calls (due to lockdown). I don't get time charge my phone properly though.Sound quality: The sound is loud and clear over calls and also during entertainment sessions of movies and video.Camera Quality: The reason I opted  this phone was I wanted  good camera to capture precious moments of my little one. So far it has been serving  the purpose. I can't comment for outdoor photography as we are all home bound owing to pandemic.Screen: The display colours and picture resolution is great owing to full HD Amoled Display. But Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is my savior as my mobile has been kicked and slipped multiple times (I am using it without a screen guard and back cover). Further  the Accidental Touch feature is awesome as I mostly  have an infant in hand while using the mobile.Body: The body is non slippery offering good grip but there will lot of finger impression left on back.Fingerprint Sensor: Only thing that doesn't  pleases me its fingerprint sensor quality which could have been better. It takes times sometimes  or I have place finger multiple times.Face recognition features works well for me and it unlocks the phone from various angles even when I am using spectacles( this becomes a problem in various other mobiles.)Overall I am happy  with the purchase so far after two months of use.

  I am reviewing SAMSUNG GALAXY M31, after using for 45 days. This is a great non Chinese smartphone. Specially the sAmoled display is mindblowing. Not only the 64 megapixel rear camera but also the 32 megapixel front camera is great. Battery of this device is a real monster. Weight distribution is great. Design is sober and I like it. Performance is also good.Display 5/5Rear camera 5/5Front camera 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 4.5/5Design & weight distribution 5/5It is a real mega monster. I love it. If you want a great non Chinese smartphone around 16k with a mindblowing display, great camera , monster battery and good performance then go for it.

Budget Friendly Feature rich Mobile.

  I bought the Samsung M31 6GB 128GB version for 16k. I use mostly online shopping apps, Streaming apps, chat, video calls.Pros1. SAMOLED screen, Pleasing to look....2. Battery life, for me with moderate use it lasts for 2 days.3. Camera Front and Back. Especially I love the Front camera...For selfie lovers it is a boon. Back camera is good but I can spot some color deviations in pictures taken using back camera as the real color is not seen in picture. But for me it is not an issue as I not using it frequently.4. Stylish looks.5. No major heating issues as I could see persons having competitors mobiles are complaining a lot about this.6. Even after 20 to 30 drops I dont see any visible even minor damage to the screen or body. Very well built device.Cons,1. Finger peint sensor and face recognition takes bit longer time then competitors devices to detect.2. Plastic body behind is fingerprint magnet and also can be easily scratched with out case. I dont like using a case so it is a issue for me.Even if you use a case you have to choose a good quality one as the bad ones themselves leave some scratches in long use3. Charging time...I know it is directly proportional to battery capacity but bit more faster charging would have been handy. Tome charging times are 3 hours 15 mins with normal charging and 2 hours 35 mins with fast charging.4. Whenever there is a software update mobile also shows a list of recommended apps that should be installed to complete the update. This came skipped but still it is annoying.Gamers.. please forgive me as I am not going to mention anything regarding the gaming performance as I have never tried even a single game with this mobile.Mobile is worth the money and my Rating is easily above 4 but if metal case and bit more faster charging options are provided I will be happily rate it 5.Thanks for the patience to read the complete review.

Best battery backup with decent camera setup

  I bought this phone for my wife. What I felt attractive is its 6K mah battery. And honestly, its doing its job well.!! My wife font of playing Gaana, streaming Netflix, Amazon prime, hotstar etc almost whole day... still battery stand upto 1.5days.!!!For those who are looking for a better battery backup phone this is it.About the camera, I won't say best, I expected much from the quad camera setup, but its average/decent like any other phone in the range(except some camera feature).

Great battery life with a good camera
",1,"

  I have been using this phone for the last 2 months. I was using the Oneplus 7T before. I am not a heavy gamer and use my device to binge-watch, click photos and use the social media apps so won't comment much on the performance. The camera to my surprise almost competed with 7T's even though it's half of it's price point.Pros:1. Camera - I find the camera to be pretty good at this price point. Both the front and back cameras have good depth. The macro camera could be a bit better but does the job for a budget smart phone. I have attached photos I clicked (clearly not a good photographer), the first is of a odd little spider using the macro camera, the 2nd and 3rd of the 64 MP camera and the 4th of the front camera2. Amoled display3. The battery life lasts for the full day easily even though I use my phone at long stretches.4. 2 sim card and an separate sd card holder - I am one of those people who watches a lot of classic movies and hence need the extra storage so this bodes well for me and I also have 2 phone numbers (work cell and personal cell)5. Not a Chinese brand.Cons-1. It's on the heavier side understandably with the 6000 mah battery2. The charger should have been at least of 25 amperes. This one takes me a good 1m5 hours to chargeOverall, I am really satisfied with the purchase. Good day to you all. ✌️

  Cons:- Camera Software need a update like NOW. Why is their expert mode when shutter speed can't  be controlled. Video is not in 60Fps.Performance lag while playing PUBG(need better software management or say gaming mode)Fingerprint sensor is a little slow compared to rivalsNeed to upgrade charger (takes like forever to charge(2hr 50min))Some glitches in display when used in full brightness mode(screen fluckers sometime)Pros:- Battery  is beast.SuperAMOLED display is just love.Dolby Atmos u will feel the difference.Good performance for everyday use.

Why  I switched 9promax to M31 .

  Camera :- Not That Much great as redmi note 9 pro max but the video option of it does provide you a great stability which not any other brand can gave u in this price point . Remember not great as redmi note 9 pro max only otherwise no other phone can beat this one  under 17k.Feature :- Absolutely  Loaded with lots of feature it does provide you the always on display great wallpapers on your lockscreen and its display is soo amazing . I'm sure u guys know what amoled display  feels like and in terms of display samsungAlways wins because of no compromises on their displays .Battery Life - You believe it or not but every day I charged my phone in night and every next day I'll use my phone about 10 hours a day and still its battery is more then 60 percent . And in lockdown we all know what we use more .Gaming performance  - I'll played pubg in first few weeks and my experience Is much better then other realms or Xiaomi devices as i played pubg in redmi note 9 pro max too but that display n that phone is horrible  in app management  and m31 performance  is smooth .At last all I want to say Is it's all up to guys what phone u prefer but if u guys loves a great display ,feature rich phone , Wants to record video with a great stability  so this phone is for u go for its .... and please guys remember  one thing display matters

  Review after 40days of use. My purpose is calls, watsapp, mails, YouTube, light gaming, browsing, gps maps, App financial transactions. With 6gb ram, this mobile dose all job smoothly.6000mah battery is really good offer. Earlier 'Battery backup' was a big issue for me due to continuous travel for my sales job.  Now, I can happily use GPS maps with worring about battery drain issue during work hrs.This is worth a buy. I charge daily night, but my observation (not tested) says, battery definitely last 1&half day with normal use.

  This is hands down the best smartphone available in the market at this price range. It performs great in almost every department.Cameras(both front and rear) are amazing. Clicks amazing detailed shots.Battery(6000 mah) is outrageous. Lasts for a day(heavy usage) or two(normal usage) easily.UI(one UI 2.0) is fantastic. Smooth and buttery experience.Display(Super Amoled FHD+)is gorgeous. Viewing angles are fantastic and color reproduction is amazing.Processor(Exynos 9611) is quite powerful. While it is not a gaming centered phone it performs above average in all high end games.Considering to but a smartphone with the best value for money? Then this is the best pick!

A Perfect Professional & Corporate phone with really nice look
",1,"

   The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support.I'm giving this review after using 1 week.Pros:Camera : The Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup at the back and a single 32-megapixel selfie shooter. The primary camera on the Galaxy M31 has a 64-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 aperture. This camera takes 16-megapixel binned shots by default but you can switch to the full resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture.Battery : I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again. 2.5 hours to full chrage.Games:If you are a professional gamer, I suggest you to go for MI brand. MI provides slightly better graphics. Overall gaming experience is nice on M31Cons:Nothing as of now.  Note : When I plugged into charging phone will slightly heatup.I bought it 2  Phones as 6GB and 8GB with 128GB storage.

  This phone is really a Mega monsterPros:- Android 10 (very fast and feels light while operating)- Stunning Display with Blue light filter (i always use the filter )- 4K video recording  UHD video 3840x2160.- 6 GB Ram enough to play most of the games- 6000 Mah battery is enough to get you through the day- Storage 128 GB (If you record 4k videos you need to get a memory card )- Fast charging with 15W brick (could have been faster but OK)- Mobile speakers sound is OK ( but not loud enough)- Camera is really good with 64 mp back and 32mp front- fingerprint sensor response is ok ( with sweaty hands you have to struggle)Cons:- Recording video with flash on the phone over heated and restarted with a message ""your phone is over heating"" (if thats a feature form Android 10 its okey to save the hardware)- you cannot zoom in or out in most camera modes (hope those can be fixed with an update)- no gestures to bring torch without unlocking phone (my previous phone has a dedicated music key which i assigned to torch)FeedbackA well built phone with good featuresI am happy I bought this phone :)

  The mobile is a wonderful all rounder. Overall performance  is very smooth.Touch is buttery, nice to work with. Display is vibrant, text is readable in bright sunlight,too.6.5 inch super amoled display is mere pleasure to look at. Enjoy movies, read text or pictures it is joyful.Camera quality is very good, especially in the light image colours are  vivid and vibrant you get lot of settings and features for back camera .selfie are good too ,but a little brighter .speaking about the performance there are no lags in day to day work., Thoughit's not for the heavy Gamers .coming to the special feature ,it has a massive 6000mh battery. you can go along two days with normal usage .For heavy users it can last a day long quite easily.fingerprint scanner is very fast and responsive Face Unlock is a bit lazy but you can manage call quality is goodand you get a very clear voice it's easy hold in  hand  and has a good grip feels very comfortable.Overall for rupees 16500 it's a great bargain, especially with 6gb of Ram and 64GB of memory the variant I've got.

Samsung M31 is Perfect Smartphone at this price range
",5,"

  I have been using samsung galaxy m31 since last 6 months and i can say that this is one of the best option to have a perfect smartphone at this price range....Pros1. Display is great with AMOLED2. Camera is top class3. Usability and screen touch is quite smooth4. fingerprint works best5. Battery is really a monster and can easily survive for at least 35 to 40 hrs..6. RAM and memory management is done pretty well on thisCons1. Exynos 9611 processor which not quite suitable for gamers but i dont complain personally2. Should have given fast charger considering its battery capacity as it takes around 2 hours 35 min approx to charge fully3. Initially i did faced some issues with device restart but then with some seetings of optimization, its working pretty well..I would definitely recommend this device to users who use smartphones for day to day use except heavy gamers...pleasedo check attached images for camera quality...ThanksGovardhan.

  In this price, the phone is superb! Mainly camera & battery of the phone is very good in price renge. Big screen gives you amazing experience of 4k videos. I ordered for blue colour but its not actually blue. Other features are great according to value. One con is the back panel. Back panel made from plastic so its have too many scratches on it. Buy a back cover along with phone is must. Go for it, love this product. Dilevery is too fast. Thank you!

  Full HD AMOLED screen the best feature of this phone.6000mah battery lasta for at least two days.Camera quality is also good.Only downside could be the Exynos processor, but will not bother you, if you don't intend to play high end games.Finally Samsung has produced a cost effective product without compromising quality to take on the Chinese onslaught.

Why you should buy the #MegaMonster
",5,"

  I got the delivery of the phone 2 days after its launch, so this review covers my experience of about 3 months-1. Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day.  This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!5. Some modes and features -•Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!• Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.• Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !

  Great Phone in this price range. Amazing battery. Although charging speed is slow, but once it charges, it does not doe easily. In this lockdown, while i am almost every hour on phone, it still gives me 1-1.25 days of backup which is amazing. Once the lockdown ends, i might get more than 2 days on medium usage. On heavy usage, i am easily getting 1.25 days of battery with SOT of more than 10 hours.Amazing camera and amazing one ui. The UI is very rich with features.Overall, I would recommend you to buy this phone with your eyes closed. No Redmi / Realme phone will give you so much confidence than this.Thank you Samsung. :)

Fack lock is outstanding. Security level is very good. This mobile phone has mamy more features like- screenshot with hand. Screen display is very smooth with gorilla glass. The Samsung prosser of this phone is best for gaming. The ram is very good and rom also. This phone also produces just small amount of radiation compare to other phone. I think this mobile can beat I phone also and at last I recommend this phone to that who want  mobile phone working for 2 or 3 year. I really....... Like this phone Samsung.

  I purchased this device on the very first day of it release, I purchased it for my Dad as he wanted a device which is simple enough to use with enough battery for everyday use and good camera to take pictures.He is not a gamer nor he is a power user , thus looking at the criteria which he needed this phone was making all right ticks .My dad is extremely happy with his purchase although when I have used the phone to just see how it is , I feel there are some software issues for example sometimes he says face unlock works sometimes it doesn't , which I believe is just a simple software fix .

  Good phone I had ever seenReviewed on samsung.comWell, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.

GREAT value!
",5,"

  I'm writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here's the detailed review of my experience using the phone.• BEST PARTS1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn't cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it ""Always On"" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it's not geared towards gaming. 9/102) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/103) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there's 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it's still there in the memory. Phenomenal!The processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don't see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN'T HEAT UP.  10/104) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn't need and couldn't be uninstalled (Samsung's mostly), so that's GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.Samsung's OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I'd always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/105) CAMERA QUALITY: I'm not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that's added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There's barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.Front camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There's also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it's just software and there isn't an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!• NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn't matter.2) The back surface is ""glasstic"" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you're good to go.3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can't detect anymore unless you clean it.So, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.P.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.

Great phone but leaves much to be desired.
",5,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Pros1. Great phone with 128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM at this price.  Definitely great  value for money.2. Total 5 cameras make it a great photography experience. (wide angle + depth + macro for close ups.3. 6000 mAh Battery lasts for more than 24 hr with moderate use. Charging is fast. Takes 2 hr to charge from  20 % to 100%.4. Switch over to USB type C cable which is going to be the future universal cable across all devices of all companies.Cons1. 128 GB memory is great but within a month it has started getting reduced with software updates. It is the same game that the mobile companies have been playing with the customers. One has to discard the phone while it is still working well because of depleting memory. Let me see how long I am able to use this phone despite my settings  to store most of the things in the SD card.2. Highest sound volume is also very unsatisfactory. In fact, the worst sound volume among all phones that I have used earlier including three different models of Samsung Galaxy.3. The positioning of cameras on margin is problematic because we are used to camera lenses positioned around the mid-line of devices. It is difficult to aim the camera with a side-aligned Macro lens.4. Default Font type and size is very small. Option of Samsung Font is provided and it has better readability.  But even after switching to Samsung font and increasing the font size through display settings it works on some websites but not on many others where the font remains small.5. The phone heats up while charging . I never experienced this heating while charging with any of my earlier Samsung phones..6. The charger has a USB Type C cable. Therefore, you have to make sure that you carry your new cable with you all the time on the go till it becomes the normal charging cable like the present Type B cables found in each home and office.7. Very difficult to take screenshots with M31 because the volume control and the on-off switch are on the same side adjacent to each other.8. Samsung has saved some money by not including  ear phones in the phone package.  Earphone  doesn't cost much but a new earphone with a new phone gives good feeling to customers. This was not expected from the cell phone giant like Samsung.

  Overall Good. 6GB RAM provides smooth operating of Phone along with Android 10 and One UI 2.0. Though fast charging feature is provided in this model, feels like its charging at normal speed and samsung needs to check with this. As I also own a Samsung galaxy M40 whose charging is really fast as compared to M31.Only drawback is that can't get proper sized tempered glass for this mobile. Hope Samsung will try to provide Proper accessories for any new Model they launch.

Excellent display! Good battery life! Decent performance!
",4,"

  It's been just 3 weeks since i bought this phone.When it comes to midrange models samsung has always been a good choice.Its performance and other features are always been decent.Galaxy M31 has some of the good features too.The First and the best thing about this phone is its display.Its 6.4"" super amoled display is awesome! Touch experience is butter smooth.If you watch lot of movies & videos then this phone is a right choice for you.Bcoz I watch lot of movies so its display quality is really great!It has a massive 6000mah battery which gives you a good battery life. I used to watch offline movies without break for more than 2 hours but the charge only decreases 10%.I think it's really great! But if you are using social media and play games a lot or surfing internet for a long time then it gives you a decent battery life of 1 day or less.This is not for heavy gamers.Pls keep in my mind the charging time is too long.It charges only 34% in 1 hour.So it surely takes 2 and half hours to charge from 0 to100%.Even though they have given an Adaptive Fast Charger it charges slowly.Due to its heavy battery and 8.9mm thickness I thought it would be bulky but surprisingly it doesn't feel heavy or bulky in hand.Thanks to its curvy finish.Cellular call quality is good.It has a single Speaker which is loud and audible.Sound through ear phone also really good.Camera takes decent photos.It has got wide angle and macro too.I have posted some sample shots here .Color Saturation is good.Camera has some more features which I haven't used it yet.Selfie camera is good. When it comes to performance I would say it's not bad at all.I haven't seen any stutter or lag so far.Gaming performance is also good.I am not a fan of PUBG so I haven't installed it.I have Real Racing 2 which played really good without any lag. Some of them has said in their review that the phone has some heating issues but in my experience the phone doesn't heat much while playing games or watching movies or doing any other task.It gets heat while charging but it's normal I think.In this price range you can get lot of other brands with very good spec.But at the end of the day its SAMSUNG.Due to its brand value the pricing is high for this specs.So finally its user's choice to go for what they wish.Overall the phone is good in all aspect.

Magnificent Product by Samsung.
",4,"

  I bought this product on 18/03/20.It has 32MP selfie camera which is best at this price range. 4K video by 64MP camera is amazing. Exynos 9611 is a very good processor and you can put limit(70%) on it by turning on power saving mode. You don't need to charge for two days because it has massive 6000mah battery. Samsung mobiles always come with it's premium Super AMOLED screen which has very nice color rendering capability. I always like Samsung products because Samsung has largest manufacturing facility in India.

Great phone at Great Price

  Great phone in all aspects at a pocket friendly price point. i was using several expensive brands earlier and i needed another phone for some generic use at home. i was looking for a good balance of quality, brand, performance and a decent price point. this samsung galaxy M31 fits that bill perfectly. i have been using this for several months now and i am extremely happy with it's performance. speed and responsiveness are great. camera quality is comparable to several expensive phones that i have at home. finger print sensor is a great relief and makes it highly usable. display quality, like all samsung devices is really superior. light weight on the pocket both in terms of it's real weight and also from the price perspective :-) Strongly recommend to budget conscious folks..

  First of all , I would say the phone has extremely good battery life while using continuously (Gaming Netflix) it delivers upto 13-14 hrs backupFingerprint reader is very fast, phone gets unlocked with just a touchCamera quality is also very good in daylight and in low light it is satisfactoryI didn't face any lag while playing PUB-G , the phone did a great job. I also loved the Super amoled display, it delivers a very good quality viewing experience.Overall the phone is doing a great Job, I didn't face any problems as of now loved it :)

M31 8GB
",4,"

  Dont get fooled by 8GB ram, it's the processor that matters. a 4GB phone with the right processor will do just fine. Had used samsung J7 pro and Note8 earlier, these were finer phones but again were a lot costlier. Camera is okay, battery is great although it takes lot of your time for charging, so full charge can happen only in the morning after you put it to charge the night before you sleep.  Do get a cover when you buy one as it is quite slippery to handle. Blue looks great, Plastic body though feels cheap. I got a 8GB ram M31 using it for about a month now, I feel 4/6 GB ram would have served the purpose just fine. Get 8GB only if you are into serious mobile gaming otherwise it doesn't make sense.

Samsung M31 from vision impaired accessibility perspective
",5,"

  with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.Overall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.

  Review after 4 months of regular usage. The product is really awesome.Pros:Awesome display. Best in its class. Color quality really awesome with good brightness.Awesome battery. Easily lasts for 2 days.Awesome camera. The images captured are having enhanced colors that are very attractive. Better result in low light compared to my other 22k phone. Memory management, even high resolution images are of ambient size. Front camera result is really awesome.Processor. Its good and I did not find any lag since I bought the phone.Weight management and balanced body.Conc.Notch display and back mounted fingerprint scanner. Other phones come with punch hole display and in-screen or side mounted scanner. But the price is higher and also in many display is ips lcd and not super amoled. So its the preference by which you should decide.

Good Camera Phone under 20000
",5,"

  It's a nice phone with good battery life, Camera is amazing-especially when coming from MI note 7 Pro or even GALAXY M30 S. Since I have switched from MI to Samsung, UI is not as convenient or familiar than my previous phone.I do not see a lot of properties when trying to restrict no of users for my hot-spot, either I can completly hide it or change password every time I do not want anyone to connect to my hot-spot (previously connected to my phone hotspot).Rest the phone is nice, it's is not 6.5 I personally like bigger phones but that is repayed by the amazing camera quality.No heating issues as of now. It takes quite some time to charge but battery backup is nice and usually goes through the day with heavy usage (WiFi, Gaming, Netflix and all).Go for it if you want to switch to Samsung its is even better than SAMSUNG A51. So please compare.

One of the Best smart phone in 2020.
",5,"

  I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.So list of Positive points:1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.4. RAM size is good as per today’s usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer)5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.Now coming to negative points from my point of view1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.One neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.Final words ""It’s a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance”

I liked cam features like slo mo and super slo mo using this for first time. 64Mp and 32 Mp back and front camera gives the phone a complete touch the quality of pics is excellent!Looks 10/10: I loved the looks of the phone. Though the back of phone is not pleasing enough but I am okay with it since I am using a coverBattery 10/10: it's mega battery indeed. 6000 mah capacity is enough for normal browsing and YouTube vids view for 1 and half day. For gaming 1 day may be.Display 10/10: i am using amoled screen after long time. View is brilliant compared to others.Speed and performance 10/10: I am not a gaming freak so for my usage this phone perfectly fits in. I didn't find any lag until now.Software 10/10: one UI core is very good indeed. Android 10 comes out of the box.Overall I am fully satisfied with this purchase.Thanks Amazon for this deal I got this phone for 13450 with exchange offer!

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good phone with lots of features for the pro. You can actually set your phone the way you want it to be. I have heard a lot  of negative comments about the camera but I found it a delight. A little concerned about the battery though it boats of 6000mAH but really doesn't last beyond a day and a half considering the least number of apps that I installed over the existing (not much) bloatware. The phone is really good in terms  of speed. I purchased the 8GB RAM + 128B internal memory version which is the best (at the time of my purchase). The screen resolution is good and display is much clear. Great features like dual volte and wifi calling. Altogether a good phone and also non-chinese. My mobile charger stopped working in the 2nd month.

  As visible from the other reviews, it is a good phone, I just wanted to concentrate on some ""not so good"" points for users for whom these might be of particular relevance:- if you turn on the router-wifi (hotspot) forget about using the bluetooth connection, the sound comes and goes- if the wifi signal is weak i get the info ""Ready to connect when network quality improves"" in the same location where i could still use the wifi, even if very weakly, with my previous phone.- I was expecting more from the battery, it does not last for two full days.Otherwise I am very happy.

Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.Finger print reader is also fast.

  Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:a) Good processing power and RAMb) Sufficient internal memory & expansionc) Good batteryd) Good cameraI'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.Some of the built-in features are good.In short, I'm happy with my purchase.

8GB RAM Phone got at Best Price

  Previously, I was using Samsung A6+ which accidentally got broken so needed one phone too as I can't get it to repair as it was during the lockdown. So, I was looking to buy this phone looking at its features, and after hearing that it will even be available in 8gb RAM and also its price. But, when I checked this phone on Amazon and Samsung website firstly it was not on stock. So, then I waited for a few days to get it. Later on, as soon as it was on stock I purchased it, and also it was my first experience to purchase a smartphone online. I received it on time and it's just a perfect phone as per my usage. I would also prefer it to everyone who wants a smartphone with good storage capacity, battery, camera, and performance then it is definitely the one.Thank you Amazon for timely and undamaged delivery and also for making it available during lockdown too.

  I had previously used Note 5, S8, and Note 9 before switching to M31. Foremost reason was massive battery life, which has proved right.Forget daily charging.

  What I like about the phone is that the touch is smooth, the back camera is good but i honestly expected better considering that is its usp. The 2nd day of using the phone my instagram stopped working and was force closing every single time and the whole phone would freeze and not work for 30secs. The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light. Also absolutely hate that Samsung has so many pre installed app which cluster the phone and is of absolute no use.Overall an okay phone, for me i expected better at 17k.

Main camera is beast because of very good post processing, Night mode impressive,Ultrawide pictures are not sharp as resolution is only 8MP. Portrait mode is also very good. Macro lens is not much useful.7. Dolby atmos support through audio jack.8. No 60fps option in videoCons:1. Plastic body feels cheap2. No knox security and secure folder3. Exynos 9611 performance is good for basic usage but for heavy usage a big No!! Due to not much powerful processor after some time performance will degrade.4. No pro mode in camera5. 15W Charging is slow for 6000mah batteryAccording to me it is good phone from Samsung at this rate for people who are not in heavy gaming and other heavy task.

Bang for the buck

  This one is the best when I bought this in the sub-20k price range.Maybe the newly launched M31s is the only that can best it.Spec wise even better than A series which is the next grade of Samsung.Good screen, good camera, good battery life. Multiple unlock options with face and fingerprint. Latest Android version. What more can you ask.

Good phone with impressive camera and battery, alongwith some issues
",4,"

  Pointwise Review after 15 day usage:Buid quality: Basic build quality with plastic uni-body, not that impressive but not that bad. Looks just fine. Back panel attracts lots of finger impressions.Screen: must be the best displays that samsung is providing in M series within this price range or comparable to even flagships.Rear camera: it has 4 rear camera sensors, here is what i felt about these:-Main 64MP sensor: probably the best in this price range, performs phenomenonal in day light conditions. However, in low light conditions you start to feel that it's a lower mid rnge phone, though all phone in this price segment struggle in low light conditions.Macro sensor: it fine, not bad. However, i had more expections with it.Wide angle sensor: pathetic qualityDepth sensor: must be the worst, very poor edge detection.Front camera: inclined towards good camera category, it can be improved.Processor: no problem in normal usage, but not recommended for those who want to play heavy games on it.Ram management: initially more than 3gb memory was always in use without software or even sim. But after tweeking the optimization settings and removing bloatware, it performing better. No complaintMemory: it's fast, no complaintBattery: it's really a monster. With normal usage of calling, camera, messaging you can easily get 2 days of battery life. It can be easily extended to even 4 days if you use very less.Charging: Though samsung claims fast charging, it's not. 15W charger doesnt seems to be really providing 15W power. Theoretically, it should charge 6000mAh battery in 2 hours, but it takes 3-3.5 hours for full charging. Not that impressive.Speaker output: it's fine, not that laud but not that low.Sound quality in earphones: Good quality output, no complaintFingerprint and face unlock: no complaintCons:1. Slow charging speed2. Very poor wide angle camera3. Poor edge detection in depth camera sensor4. One serious problem that others also faced: randomly 2 times it got rebooted itself and stuck on boot screen for 20 minutes. I have to see if it persists.Edit: after july OTA update battery performance reduced significantly.Edit: after 1.5month of usage; working fine. Rebooting problem didnt happen again after OTA update. Battery performance was better before the update. However, still it's not bad. One need to tweek app settings to optimise the juice suckling of the apps.

  Awesome device. The One ui is filled with lot of features .The camera and battery 6k mah is best.Camera quality is sharp with better detailing,good dynamic range.Must buy it.Selfie camera Sensor sony (imx616) is great.The 5mp macro shots are better.Built quality is better than m30s.The camera is far far better than any other brand phone in this price.But the back side can be easily  scratched so its better to use a case or vinyl.Battery lasts approx  2 days without using internet. Battery lasts 10hour 30 minutes of continuousgaming, video playback, etc...Camera: 10/10Battery: 10/10Built quality: 9/10User interface:10/10Display:10/10Gaming: 9/10 ( medium level gaming. Better gaming experience in PUBG with medium graphic settings)Pros:-FHD+ sAMOLED display-Accurate GPS-Large 64mp samsung gw1 sensor- 32 MP Sony imx616  sensor- 6000mah batteryCons:- 15W charger takes long time to charge_  Glossy polycarbonate body get  scratched easily.

A gift for us from Samsung ❤
",5,"

  I don't know where to start speaking about this amazing phone and its amazing features.Samsung has truly given us a gift with the M31 model.The monster battery of 6000 MaH is definitely the higight, but apart from the amazing battery we need to take out time to appreciate how beautifully Samsung has balanced the weight of this huge battery in this handy phone without it being bulky. It is truly crazy!I have been using this phone for a little over a week now, and I am just in love with everything it has to offer.The camera quality is just amazing, people just need to make sure that they set the default output of the pics at 64 Mp as the phone naturally clicks pics at 16 Mp mode to save space.I love that my phone is add free (which is such a relief!) And all the other features are just so fun to use!This phone is seriously a SNATCH at the price Samsung has introduced it. The best of features at such a great deal.Just go for it without a blink if you are looking for a phone under 20000.This is truly a treat to use. You wont regret it.

M31 good for a 17k budget phone for long run
",5,"

  Pros-Battery life (it lasts for 1.5- 2 days approx for me  with social networking apps and video streaming 2-3hrs viewing)- Crisp display to watch HD videos- Fingerprint sensor response is faster after unlock button is pressed than direct fingerprint unlocking.Cons- Backbody gets dirty easily and has sticky feeling when palms are sweaty.- Night time camera both front and back is full.- Speaker Sound is good but Bass sound is not clear-Camera cuts the side when a document is captured. Sides will be cut than what is shown on screen while capturingSeeing price range I would suggest it is a good buy. But if you have some additional budget go for M31s as body looks more premium than M31.

  I was using a Nokia phone from last 1 year however it started giving me charging problems so I decided to get a new phone but lockdown was going on in the country and everyone was boycotting Chinese products so I was really in a delima on which phone to pick up on, did a lot of searches on web to find which one I should for I don't know why after reading everything about other phones in my mind I had a trust building for this Samsung M31, my friends were giving me suggestions about other phones but I ordered this phone because of its massive battery and smooth in using every feature. I hope my trust remains as it is. I have promoted this phone in my friends and we all have same phones with different colors.  This phone has win my heart..

  Samsung galaxy M31 phone is the best phone you can purchase with same amount you can't fine a full package like this in any other phone with same price range . The fingerprint reader is very quick and easy to start same goes with face scanner that is also very quick which I liked very much. And now if we talk about battery life that is also very high it will definitely change your charging habits and what can I say about camera quality it is fantastic .

  Awesome camera, Review is not really nessessary to Samsung camera, from galaxy grand till now they never let you complain about camera, shared wide angle and micro camera quality, And I'm really not good in photography.When its come to battery i cannot complain I'm really a smartphone addict and never put my phone down. And till the time i have it on my hand it never run out of battery, i put this to charge when i go to sleep. Fast charging really works awesome if you forget to charge it and wanted to have some battery before leaving the home.Fingerprint is multifunctional and work very smoothly. There are other features in phone which really works awesome.Device care is awesome app so you do not need those third party advertisers cum cleaner.5 🌟 on everything. Nothing got to be complain as of now.

  My father has been using this mobile since last 2 month and did not face any problem. I bought it yesterday in black colour and it feels so great to have this mobile. However, while setting up I faced 2 issues and 1 from a friend1- playstore was not updating or installing g new application2- YouTube was getting crashed.3- A friend of mine who bought this a month back told me that Vodafone and bsnl signals are very weak in this mobileI fixed the above two issues after watching youtube issues and seems it is very common problem with M31 and can be fixed within 5 minutes. The one my friend faced has no solution as I had the same issue with my airtel number when I had moto g5s plus.Overall I give this mobile 4 out of 5. Please go for it but make sure your internet provider is compatible with m31

Smooth ,elegant, and good to have it in hands in some sense.

  64mp camera is not that good. Its image orocessing for 64mp is bad. It is like drawed picture more or less when you zoom more. Its colours are not that real and it doesnt feel that good to take 64mp photo. Its battery is good but at the first charge it took ages for me to get 100 percent. But after that it got quicker i.e it got to its original speed of charge. Software and its ui looks premium and good. There is a little lag while you fast open recent apps ( You can see it rarely, but for some apps u see it for sure). But overall its good. You will see some features which are that useful to you but when you see it will feel good. I think samsung does it because it wants yo make us feel luxury( but luxury in the sense not that useful but it is there) and honestly it feels good to have it. You will feel it good, simple, elegant to have it in your hand.

After uses of more than 5 months i am writing this review.Benefits:-1.You will have an awesome call clarity over speaker,headphones, bluetooth or over the ear.2.if you are music lover it has multiple play options along with Digital dolby which really make feels of sound ocean(i am using sony MDRzx220BT)3.Screen resolution is awesome and reading mode is perfect. SAmoled gives you feel of touch.4.Battery life is as expected. With continuous music listing and net surfing it will last a day.normal uses 2 days around. It's really monster.5. Camera is really awesome and in night mode it's clarity you can see. Super se upper. Wide angel feature is cool and you can cover larger areaYou may get upset when:-1. During phone update you may fill mobile is getting heated.2. S/R ratio is low which is good for your health but if network strength is low you may get call drop.3. Front camera is little lagging but through settings you can take perfect selfy.4.

Best Mid Range Smartphone ever by Samsung
",5,"

  This phone has mainly 3 main objective:Monster battery, camera and display.I will give review in details about this phone.Battery: with approximately 2hrs of gaming time and 7hrs of screen time battery life took almost 30-33hrs to come from 100% to 5-15%. As well as it took almost 4-4.5 hrs to fully charge from 5% to 100%.Camera Quality: I have attached few picture samples from ultra wide angle to macro to 64MP shot to 32MP selfie shot. The camera Quality is excellent but if Samsung could add the single take feature by some software update, this phone could be unbeatable at this price segment.Fingerprint reader: it's very responsive and took micro second to respond. It's face unlock feature is also great responsive.Processor: exynos processor is good but can't handle heavy game, expecting Snapdragon chipset later in this range as well as I really want ardeno GPU than this Mali, but due to having 6gb ram and 128gb storage phone didn't lag at all but I personally need the change in GPU at least.Speaker volume is average. Best advantage is having 3.5mm headphone jack port.Having 3 in 1 slot i.e. 2 nano SIM and 1 dedicated micro SD card slot.Back panel is very fingerprint catcher, but using a case can solve this issue.And that's all from my review, feel free to rate my review high and can ask me any queries related to this smartphone.

  I really like the camera. The battery life was very good .It took me around 2 days to completely discharge the battery.The amoled screen was like cherry on the top of cake .They only complain I have is there is a minor lag in viewing the picture after taking a snap .It takes a pause of 2-3 sec which was bit unusual for me because  the phone performance was very good and  It is very fast . The other thing is there is no stabilization in macro mode and the night mode is pretty good  (it's  not very good ).Ignoring these minor defects  ...the phone is all in all very good .I'm satisfied  with it.The delivery by Amazon was fast and the phone was neatly  packed .

  It’s a decent phone if you are planning to gift it to your parents.IMPORTANT NOTE: If anyone of you face issues with call drops, just select the network manually instead of default automatic selection.One thing irritates me is it takes ~3hrs to charge the phone even though it comes with fast charging option. Better we should have received 25W charging in place of 15W.

  Everything is fine :-That is Good battery ,Strong processor and cameras were too good ..Trust me i played pubg over on it for like 8-9 hours in smooth mode but didn't find any lag heating issues were usual as like on other devices ,6000 mah is real op that led me to give a strong backup of full 1 days with heavy usages. Only thing is is bad and disturbing in it is its charging speed ie so slow afterall having with 15 watt of its original charger it use to take like 3.5-4 hours to get fully charge seriously disgusting but hopefully its other features backlash that ........

Samsung Galaxy M31 review post 2 months usage
",5,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31, A brilliant product by Samsung! This phone just grabs attention...The Camera quality is superb as I have seen till now, the 64 Megapixel camera just excels. The quad camera does it job in a very useful manner, 64 MP main camera  has a f1.8 aperture, 5 mp depth camera has a f 2.2 aperture,  5 mp macro camera has f 2.4 aperture and the last one 8 mp 123° Ultrawide camera has f 2.2 aperture.  Each camera excells in it's own way, the 5mp camera  focuses on the depth ina very keen manner , 5mp macro camera focuses on every object that is too close in a matter of 3-5 cm distance,  8mp 123° Ultrawide camera brilliantly captures all those scenarios which you wish to have it in your phone.Video quality is so Good that it feels like you are a photo-video maker.  The super steady video feature helps in video making, and it will be usefull if you are a vlogger.Talking about the screen, the 6.4"" inch sAMOLED FHD(Full HD) + infinity U display will give you a attention grabbing feel.Battery performance is so good that you can use it a whole day! I get a total 21 hours of backup time Including Internet, Music, Video all combined together.Talking about the processor it just excels in this performance, the 6GB ram 2.3 GHz quadcore processor will help improve gaming experience along with AI game booster.Charging capacity has been Increased with 15W Fast charging  within no time you can charge your phone!Overall I liked this phone very much and I recommend you to go ahead without giving a second chance.

  Pretty heavy phone to handle.great response time from one window to another, excellent refresh rate on the screen.Didn’t like was too much heating on the phone. May becoz of the 6000 mah battery at the back but it’s ok as most of phone do heat up.Battery life is something on how the person uses it, it’s recommended that use the phone till it indicates it needs to be charged say 15% or even 5%. And then charge the phone back again. To have healthy battery life.

  Phone built quality is good. It's a very rigid phone. I have already dropped it thrice but thank God phone is working normal till now.Camera quality is AWESOME. It is best in this price range. But camera is not so quick. Phone gives lag while using camera.Battery life is normal if we see a 6000 MAh battery. My usage is mostly internet and I use Bluetooth connection also. I get around 8 to 10 hours of battery life when Bluetooth and location is on.Finger print sensor is working fine. But I think it could be a faster one.Phone is not so quick while using multiple windows. It gives lag.Overall I am fully satisfied with the phone performance.

Alright for the Price. Disappointed with Battery!

  6 MONTH REVIEW:I came to this phone after using the S7 for 3 years and finally decided to move on to a bigger screen and also the battery on the S7 had seriously degraded to a point where I had to recharge it twice a day.So one of my major draw for this phone was the 6000 mAh battery sadly that was the most disappointing part of the phone. The phone was advertised as having a 2 day battery but with my primary usage of watching videos it hardly lasts an entire day.It does last 2 days on light usage though which comes handy when traveling. I have disabled fast charging to allow my battery to last longer but even in cable charging mode the phone charges quite fast which is good.It also used to hang and restart abruptly quite often initially but after multiple updates it seems to have stabilized.The fingerprint reader requires multiple tries to work as it seems to attract smudges which inhibit it's performance.The Camera was one of the prime reasons to buy the phone and it's perhaps the best feature of this device. I usually use the 64mp feature for highest quality which it delivers.Overall for the price the phone is alright but hopefully Samsung can improve the battery life through some future updates.

Best in class and best in market

  One of the best smart phones in the market right now, when it comes to the camera I have observed it takes awesome shots with front and back camera, and in low lighting it awesome.With day to day usage If you play heavy games like asphalt 9, pub g mobile exsynos 9611 gives awesome performances  with game booster I perfectly  maintain ram and processor for optimal performance and heating issue too minimal.Coming to battery life powered by 6000 mAH it gives best performance as of normal usage like social media, surfing taking shot, watching movie and listening to songs battery can last up to 1 and half day easily. When you do heavy gaming like pub g and all in full charge u can play 5,6 hours continuously.Coming to online streaming and entertainment  app like netflix and prime video it supports widevine L1 support as know as HD streaming or you can watch movies, series in high definition.Now the coming to design it samsung glastic  design which feel premium in hands and u water drop notch display with quad camera setup is just awesome.Now the trade mark and the best part of samsung smart phone display 6.4 inches, 1080x2340 Full HD super AMOLED display with 83.92% screen to body ratio. It really best part of smart with color full display  and out door brightness  is all awesome.

  1. I'm writing this review after 120 days of usage, using the 6GB Ram /128GB version.2. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon - within 72hr delivery.(b) The phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(c) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(d) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo, realms and Mi. Works like a flash.(e) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(f) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. Front camera is average.(g) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(h) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking approx 3hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.(c) Finger touch has less sensitivity.5. Otherwise I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

  First of all after 1 month of using m31, i am now going to post a review about it.. so let's start with the followingScreen-first of all if you are a movie lover or watch movies mostly on mobile then its samoled has no comparison and is best in all cotegories.Battery- optimization of battery is not so good, but yeah you can play pubg continuous for almost 7-8 hrs which is quite impressive.. now you can think of urself how good is its batteryProcessor-its processor is quite good, but but but optimization of it is worst, 9611 is quite gud, if it may be optimized well..with the software and games..You can get fps around 35-55 in pubg smooth +extremeBody-body is made of plastic, and no frame but yaa with a cover it look amazing🖤Weight- with a massive 6000mah battery weight of the phone is well managed not so heavy, not so light, normal normal but yaa more than normal devicesLast but not the leastAdvice-download Package disabler pro and disable all bloatware.. it will make your device more smooth...I guess in the next update they will optimize the processor and fix there services bugs..Stay safe❤

  Very best product at this range. Battery and camera is awesome. Network connectivity is not as strong as M30 but it could be better with some updates.

Good Smartphone Samsung M31

  After using almost a month my review of Samsung M31...I was not fan of Samsung smart phones. I have been using some other brand for last 6 yrs. And my last phone is still continuing...as I could not book desired model of that brand I switched to Samsung with almost same spec and price.Pros:1. Camera : Camera is good.2. OS : Latest Android...Looks good...3. Battery backup is best.4. Charging adapter is really fast.5. Display is nice...6. Space is a lot... memory card is not necessary... of course a backup space is fine to keep.7. No hybrid slot...so...two sim and memory card is easy to install.8. Battery saving mode is available that can give a longer battery life...good while travelling...Cons:1. Speraker : Sound quality is not good. Even call sound seems littled distorted.2. Default Message App - I needed to change this.3. Sensor that control screen light during call needed some upgradation...it does not work always...4. Missing default app that displays CPU and resource usage5. Missing metal back...Overall experience is good for this phone...

  I jss received the product in morning.i am using it to check features and i found two major issues.its heating very quickly.and secondly there is lag in sound and video while making watsapp and duo calls. have a30  that is performing better.if there is any possible solution to this.camera quality  is ok in daylight.it took exactly 2.5 hrs to charge.i may be too quick to review so I am going to observe the device for two more days.lets see.After two days i am satisfied with battery performance and the display  is indeed wonderful.face unlock is slow.All i need now is tempered though its not required but i am to clumsy  in handling mobiles.sombody please suggest  the one that shouldn't  affect the feel of screen.Overall its ok for daily use nothing like awsmm but its good.

  The M in the phone really stands for a monster. The battery back up of the phone is awesome. You can easily relly on the phone for 2 days of the battery time. The camera is also very great and gives you exquisite images and videos. And everyone knows screen quality of the samsung is best in the industry. Also,  the performance of the phone is really good, in day to day usage the phone is really great and if you use it for gaming I bet you won't regret it.

M31 phone is binary in nature - it's worth but not worth
",5,"

  Worthy points of its cost:1) Gorgeous Display - No company provides sAmoled at this point of cost.2) Battery - 6000mah? Yes it is. I don't have to say anything about it.3) Camera - 64mp and 32mp sensors perform well in good lighting conditions.4) UI - Best UI after oxygen UI. It has all the suffosticated requirements for a normal user.5) Software updates - The company has promised  2 to 3 years of software update. That's a good.Unworthy points of its cost:1) Plastic built - Really? For 16K? Come on samsung.2) GG3 - Atleast we can say it has protection. But in reality I don't think so.3) 15w charging - The company claims this is fast charging.  Really? Then what do you say about 30w, 55w,65w and 120w charging... is it slow charging?4) 9611 - Well well... look who is here... the same old guy from past century...  Gamers.. beware of this old guy...  if you ever heard 9611 stay 10 feet away. I bet you will get better phone than this.On conclusion. For samsung lovers this phone is best but for normal users... I bet u will have better options on market.

Good phone but could 've been better

  i am writing this review after a week of usage.Camera quality, screen size,  is good and battery charging is fast comparatively.Battery life is good but best as per the ads and promos given by Samsung even though it says 6000mah couldn't find any big difference than other 4030mah phones.Cons: simple things like App lock, auto brightness and front screen sensor  (instead they are using the front camera itself for sensing but the performance is poor in that aspect ) ,favorite settings in contacts etc are not there which is considered basic for any smart phone.

Decent budget Smartphone
",5,"

  First of all, this is a china-free smartphone. Samsung produces no smartphone in above mentioned country.This piece is a value for money product. I am experiencing a monstrous battery life with decent super amoled display.You will definitively observe a mind boggling viewing experience.Blue light effect is quite helpful for eyes. And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.Cons:Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers. In low graphics, you can observe playable fps.Charging time is approximately 180-190 minutes from 0-100. Fast charging needs improvement.Samsung could have provided an earphone, unfortunately, there's none.Summary:This is a value for money smartphone which focus is to grab attention of movies and TV show audience. If you go for it, one thing you'll definitely not have is regret.

Stunning, Impressive, Well done Samsung
",5,"

  Let me expand on first impression; the packaging was good, sturdy and sanitized — which is great. Smarphone came with all the accessories written on the box.There was no charge in the unit—odd I remembered samsung delivering fifty percent charge in there products, either way I did boot it up after leaving it for charge for around three hours — fast, responsive display, beautiful camera. And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects — but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography — although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.

  I bought this for my friend, best budget phone with extra features, very good battery backup, camera, display and quality , it's is not available in Shops, only thing is it takes 1.5+ hrs to charge, but once you charge 100% then no need to worry, best replacy to Chinese products also, I'm using Redmi phone , but I'm impressed with M31 , before I shifted to Redmi from Samsung because of battery and hanging issues, but now they are back with good phone...

  It's a good phone in this price. However, since the price is low many security features in this phone is compromised like Secure Folder, Samsung Pay, Knox etc.  Since the price is low Samsung has taken off many of these features which were even available in the earlier J Series.Performance: Although this phone comes with 6 GB RAM the performance is good as A Series phones which almost comes in the same price.Camera: Camera quality is also not that good as A Series phones although M31 comes with 64 MP back and 32MP front camera.Battery: 6000mAh battery will come for one and half dayIf you are looking for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage with better performance, I would rather suggest to go for A51 which will be little higher in price.

Good Mobile from Samsung at low price.

  I prefer Samsung than any Chinese brand mobile because I believe it's more reliable and trusted brand.M31 is having good display, camera is good, and awesome battery backup. Only  issue I found with this mobile is it takes a long time to charge about 2 hours, so having 6000mAh is not effective unless you keep it at charge on night (the reason for 4 star).

Best buy for 16k
",5,"

  I have been using this device for more than 2 weeks. I am an above-average user the battery lasts around 40 hrs plus. I am happy with the device.1. About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for meNB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers

Decent phone which is actually made in India

  I would rather recommend this phone rather than the Samsung M31s since most of the features are already available in Samsung M31. Albeit the camera quality is a bit lower than M31s. If you click too many close range photos then I would suggest go for the M31s. But if that doesn't bother you then paying extra 2000 bucks for trivial enhancements is not worthy. The bad thing is that it does not come with a cover and you have to buy one from outside.

Honest review after more than 30 days of usage
",5,"

  The overall performance of this mobile is good.There will be a slight lag in unlock when fingerprint sensor is used and some times if you touch it also it says to cover the sensor fully. Earlier I was a mi user but I never found such problem in my old mobile.Camera and battery are the best things in this mobile.But some times I see that the phone hangs. This might be a major drawback of this mobile.Conclusion: If u are a gamer or a heavy user of multimedia. This mobile is not worth for your use. This is good for only those people who use it for nominal multimedia purposes.

  Now this a magnificent smartphone that I am holding in my hand and writing this review. If you are looking for the best camera phone with huge battery back and RAM, then look no further. The 6GB RAM galaxy m31 is the best smartphone in the market which will provide you with amazing features like 64MP primary Camera and a 32MP secondary camera. Want to see pictures ? Go on and check those amazing pictures of the River Brahmaputra, Assam. Stunning, isn't it? Want to go for a tour and record amazing videos ? Do not even worry of battery backup. The 6000 mAh battery in one single charge will be enough for you to click as many pictures a day, record videos and play games as well, forget the battery , it will be enough to last around 24 hours even after heavy use. So go on and order your Galaxy M31. And if you wish to upgrade, look no further than the newly launched galaxy m31s which has many amazing features too just at ₹19.5k. But that review is reserved for another day. Take care and stay indoors.

  Best buy for an average consumer for media consumption, watching youtube, and streaming services online...The screen alone makes it worth of buying as it's way way better than the panels on its competition.The camera quality is great and even better than the competition.Battery life deserves a mention wherein for a heavy user, you won't be left searching for charges... it easily lasts one full work day without needing to be charged.Fingerprint scanner could be better positioned but its fast which is great.Gaming would be slightly compromised when compared to its competitors, but I dont think an average user would notice it, because the screen has wonderful color accuracy and contrastOverall the best purchase in this price range.

  This is my first Samsung phone. My family and friends everybody is using Samsung from longtime, so i thought i should try Samsung now. So i ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 as it was the latest phone with better config than any other phones and also the price was reasonable as compared to others.When i received my phone and when i started using it it was marvelous. I read the comments and reviews before purchasing and got mixed reviews about the phone. But when i started using it and noticed about the comments and reviews as given by the others, it was nothing like that. Camera is Superb and Macro feature is awesome. Battery performance is good, display is magical, slightly heating when playing games like COD Mobile, Pubg and Fortnite but it's common.Overall, the phone is really a MegaMoster. The price is good, features are awesome, body is good, sleek design.As per my opinion, buy this and get amazed with best quality and services by Samsung.

  Fingerprint reader is awesome both in its view and working.Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*

  Its Exynos 9611 Processor, Rear Quad camera setup with wide angle and macro shot capability, 6 GB RAM and most importantly its price (Comparable to many Chinese smartphones). I ordered 2-phones, one was delivered on 8th July and the other on 16th July 2020. I am using this phone for normal usage and for Amazon prime to view movies.The only problem I am facing sometimes is the net connectivity issue when Samsung Max VPN is ON (May be Ultra data saving mode is ON). When I put it off, then the connectivity resumes. Overall, its a great phone. I strongly recommend to buy it over Chinese make smartphones. Now the Samsung Galaxy M31s is also available with an infinity display with a price of Rs.2000 more.

Fingure reader is faster in camparision to face unlock. 128GB storage is also more than enough.Problem with it is its operating system compared to 5 year old mi prime 3s phone it seems little dumb.Eg. 1) Face unlock needs you swipe to return to your previous screen.2) Tapping on date / time do not take you to calender or clock setting3) If you turned on flash light pressing power button twice it should turn off4) QR camera given by default on notification bar is never works like QR code scanner it is normal camera or it is confusing.

M31 In depth review
",5,"

  Got this after my long stint with the Lenovo Zuk Z2 plus. Jumping from a Snapdragon (820) to an Exynos was difficult, but had no other choice. After a lot of searches and collating data and feedbacks, went for the Galaxy M31 (6+128). Was planning for an 8gb model but was not sure how good Exynos 9611 would handle tasks, so went with one level down. To be honest this phone does the job very good and more than what is expected. Back is a finer print magnet and the open camera is prone to damage unless a good back cover is put on. App loading time is a bit high. Fingerprint and face unlock is fast though the face unlock takes a longer time sometimes. I tested face unlock in dark environment and worked good as the brightness fills up your face from the device to capture the face. Similarly works for night time low light selfies. Games run smooth with minor frame drops at high settings otherwise you wouldn't find any (I am not a gamer though tried quite a few for sometime off in the lockdown). Has a specific game booster mode. There's no lag on the phone unless you install multiple apps as in my case. I have a usage of lot of apps at all times on my phone (32 as of now including the preinstalled ones). You'd only find lags while opening the app drawer beacause the phone is unable to handle so many apps installed. If you are not into keeping many apps on your device this is the perfect phone for you. Camera quality is good. Has a night mode which captures good pictures in low light. But selfies in low light are not good. This phone did not disappoint me (only if I have lesser apps). Preinstalled apps are removable. Battery backup is very good and with a fast charger is power packed. Faster fast charger would have been more helpful for this battery though. Liked it but would be happier only Samsung could have shortened or removed the notch with a punch hole as in the M31s. Samsung does not provide SD processor and Amoled screen together and they have been running the same old 9611 processor of theirs on all recent (previous ) and new phones as well from the A & M series. It's time Samsung thinks about it. Just not to increase the price of a phone with few new features and same old processor won't do good. Overall a good phone to go for. A tough competitor with other Chinese counterparts. You can also checkout the M21 which only has a difference of camera (48mp) if you want to save some bucks. Other features mostly remain the same.

  In this phone everything specifications are described in the detail section.  But the actual thing is we should  buy or not. Then I am telling you my experience with this phone.In daily usases this phone is absolutely fine in this price segment. Only one thing is that you can play PUBG on recommended settings  not on the high settings for long time. Otherwise there is no any issue in this phone. Only one thing I want to say that this phone is the best.Love it. Display is absolutely fine.Go for it.

  Excellent  phone and very much satisfied with the features of the phone.  The camera is too good and battery life is awesome. This proven again as Samsung is best in its quality.  The camera inbuilt AI features are very helpful and easy to use.  Overall I taken the right decision choosing this phone and that too with so many features within the reasonable budget.  I do recommend to my friends to go ahead buy this phone.  I also appreciate Amazon service who delivered this phone with in agreed time.

Total review of M31
",5,"

  The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin, but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.

A complete value for money premium Quality phone

  A very awesome mobile, a complete  value for money.Main highlights are its awesome display, battery and performance.One can argue with the performance when u take gaming into account. But believe  me even in gaming its performance  is awesome.Its a daily life phone, awesome super amoled display for entertainment ,6000MAH battery for continuous work and decent performance.The thing i dont liked that much...1. Camera pic output...some are good some are not natural, its seems artificial.2. No fast charging support..it takes nearly 2hr 45 mins to charge it completely.These are not major negatives about this phone if compare at the price its been offered.GO AHEAD FOR IT.....👍👍👍👍👍

Amazing sexy looking- Function of taking selfy using our hand palm.- Font is also good.- Brightness is great even in sun light.- Bluelight filter can help to reduce stress of eyes to use phone in nightI strongly recommend to buy this phone.

SUPER PHONE UNDER 20000
",5,"

  OCEAN BLUE, 6+128The product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.1. Camera QualityThe quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.Front camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.Overall camera is excellent .2. DISPLAYWith the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.Needless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.Although the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.3. BATTERY LIFEThe most demanding feature in any cellphone.For normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.On the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.I have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.4. GAMEPLAYPUBG never lagsWhenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not  working properly.Otherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.5. RAM & ROMThe buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.With 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.6. FINGERPRINT READERYou can add more than one fingerprint.Beside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.Overall it's best phone in the market below 20000.The only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.The one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.

*Beast of the Segment*
",5,"

  *Looks_Premium*Samsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone — plastic that looks and feels like glass — which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.And don't let the ""glass"" in “glasstic” fool you, it’s still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it’s glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn’t look cheap, unlike its predecessor.Battery Life- An Absolute BeastPacking a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That’s on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you’d have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.Samsung Galaxy M31 – 4The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn’t cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone’s AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you’ll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.Camera Quality- Good but not BestGood quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensorShots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic rangeThe ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges)Photos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image qualityLive Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the backgroundThe macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution)The 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy)Overall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2)Overall Verdict:Samsung's Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.

Amazing buy for this price range
",5,"

  Fingerprint reader works quite well but not so amazing as my old redmi note4 because it only works if your finger is completely moisture and dust free. Camera quality is amazing, works well even in low light. Even though I expected a little bit more battery life (I am using always on screen and maximum cpu usage) it is pretty good. Screen quality is good and I have to say that even for an above average hand sized person like me, it is difficult to use this handset in a single hand (you cannot access the notification bar while using a single hand). The lenght of the phone is a bit over sized i guess. Talking about other physical attributes, it is a bit over weighted because of the 6000mAh monster of a battery it is packing. There are a lot more advanced features encorporated in this handset and most of them are very much user friendly.  I have been using this phone for 2 months now and honestly speaking I have encountered hanging 2 times. But both of the times it was the application that wasn't resposding. First time I had tried to close the application and it took some time to respond to it. I know its a bit harsh to criticize such a phone that provides so much for a budget price but I thought it would be better to give an honest experience here because for buyers like me every penny is hard earned!Thanks.

  On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.Talking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.Fingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.Many people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.The mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.Finally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.

  This phone is amazing in every terms.Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag.  I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 8GB ram and software gives smooth experience.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodNot So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- poor low light camera performance.- processor could be better.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Overall rating: 4/5Been using this as my primary and only phone for around 6 months now. So far so good. I'll keep this short and to the point:Pros:1- smooth operation most of the time.2- camera is really good. Good modes, good clarity. Sizable upgrade from my old moto g5s plus.3- screen is good. No complaints.4- audio quality is good but could have been better5- battery is a genuine masterpiece. Lasts close to 2 days with very heavy usage and that's good enough for me.6- pleased that this is manufactured in IndiaCons:1- occasional stutters. I don't know why but occasional app transitions stutter and it can get annoying. It's not very common but say I swap between WhatsApp and Reddit while typing something, there is a noticeable stutter. Hope this gets fixed. Update: it has reduced but it is still noticeable2- fingerprint sensor could use some speed enhancements3- facial recognition is in my opinion it's downside. I don't use it much but it is very sloppy and inconsistent.4- NO IP RATING. I'm surprised that I overlooked this at the time of purchase, but this is a genuine let down. I can handle my phone well, but this can definitely screw with your usual usage if you are a rough user.All in all, phone does my daily activities well and I don't have too many complaints, but I'd have liked it if they fixed the stuttering and had added an IP rating.

Best option in lower mid range phones

  After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.

Just go for it or try for newer model which has even better battery.

Best Non Chinese Tag Phone under 20K
",4,"

   Writing this review after using this phone approx 26 days..So there will be complete review about this..Why i brought this:-Because i want to switch more safer android smartphone, market of samsung is less than others cheap prices tag company phones but in Android nothing is more safer than samsung.. because there security patch is better in terms of all..Also i need better UI, i was earlier using MIUI, & want to use new Ui specially with flagships tag phones..In world people prefer Apple than samsung..In India we brought what we saw is cheaper or just processors.What they ""भाई इसमे snapdragon hai"" just snapdragon doesn't makes ur phone good or best..Samsung has world class infrastructure to provide the best thing to u not just anything without prior experience...So heres few things i like most..1. Super Amoled Display: its having suoer amoled display which is way better than anyone in this budget.. as samsung super amoled consider as best due to high ppi.. which makes every dot if colors very good..Suitable for netflix, prime, video watchers .2. Battery: it has 6000 mah battery which is highest in this budget segment with 15W fast charging, took almost 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%But belive me if its charge 100% use continuously till evening, and still u have 20-30% left..PS: normal use, not games..3. Quad camera: it has quad camera 64-8-5-5 which is also not available in this budget segment in any others..Same configuration..Plys sasmung has better image processing softwares and good sensors..Hence the camera quality is also good... I had attach pics too..64 mp main camera, 8mp wide angle, 5 mp macro camera, 5mp depth camera.. 32 mp front camera..With 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL also Bright GW1 image sensor.Slow mo with super slowmo which is way better, live focus, night mode is excellent... 4K recording from front as well as primary cameraAll these are good...4. Exyons 9611: it has Exyons 9611 which is better than many processor, it runs PUBG as well as many heavy games at HDR quality without any frame rate down, not even lags..So good one.. yes its not better than snapdragon but yes it works better till now i found nothing negative from processor..5. Audio: it has one good quality of speakers and very loud..It comes with Dolby atmos hence using external source of speakers from this phone is way better....Best phone in under 20K segment, i brought this in 17K 6-128Gb configuration..If u want this for just only Gaming than dont prefer this, if u want daily use mobile with less gaming, and high usage of videos, social sites surfing etc than its best one...What i was thinking to get more1. Gorila glass 5 for screen instead of 32. Face lock little bit faster (although no use of face lock bcoz maximum prefer finger lock)3. Liquid cooling technology if possible (bcoz if u play pubg for more than hours in full settings it will heat little bit but not as Xiomi phones did)4. Want some more colors.. only royal blue & black with plastic body.. still it looks betteeI m using black one..5. Atleast add Case in mobile box, only charger provided...I hope i added the valid points....PS:- it is made in India, and has no links with China bcoz samsung has world largest factory in Noida where these phones were made, not assembled.. most of the parts were manufactured in India, only super amoled screen shipped from South Korea and few other parts from various countries..As all company's did.. but has no link with china.. for more google it

Samsung Galaxy M31 vs Redmi Note 5 pro
",5,"

  I am writing review on comparing it with Redmi note 5 pro as I have used previously this one  and to be honest I don't find this M31comparable to it.Still some reality check is necessary,  so that I am writing this review after using M31 for 45 days of use.I bought it as an alternative to Chinese brands but feels lag on several departments.1.In fingerprint reader, you will not be able to notice it when ur mobile get opened by touching  fingerprint sensor,  in note 5 pro vibration with fingerprint sensor touch was there to make it easier.2. Even with 4000mAh battery note 5 pro was working whole day well and no battery drain problem was at all.Now with 6000mAh battery I get also whole day battery backup and little more than note 5 pro. In M31 I fell battery drain problem of almost 10%,when I woke up in the morning.3. Camara quality is more better in M31 than note 5 pro, but you have to also mind that note 5 pro was launched 2year before . And even at that time it was providing excellent camera quality.4. Touch screen with S-amoled in M31 is excellent.5. Non availability of front flash while in note 5 pro it was.6. In spite of fast charging option, the 15W charger provided with pack of it is not enough to charge it fast, you have to buy another high capacity charger.7. Loudspeaker has less volume compare to note 5 pro.8. Blue light emit more comparable to note 5 pro. I always use it in filter mode.9. Price wise it is good, got  M31 with 6+128 in 17 k compare to 4+64 in 15k of Redmi note 5 pro.

  This is truly an amazing phone. Have been using it for over a month now. The price is quite affordable and the performance has been really good. The fingerprint scanner was comfortable to use while holding the phone.The 6000mAh battery definitely gives a long lasting performance and it's really impressive. With the 15W charger provides a quick charging time, with the battery life lasting for nearly a day.The camera quality is quite good although not the very best but at this price range, it's definitely worth it. I particularly found the quick detection and focussing of the 64MP rear camera quite helpful while capturing the pictures in daylight.The wide angle lens do give you good pictures though they could be slightly distorted at the edges. The 5MP macro camera is also quite decent and captures really good images in the daylight.Potrait shots were good and the camera app gives you the option to blur the picture to your desired level. I found the 32MP selfie camera to be very good. Overall pretty much satisfied with the camera performance.Software performance and UI are top notch. Although the design of the phone is good, the heavy battery adds to weight. This can be a slightly good thing as the phone might not slip easily out of hand.I bought the Ocean Blue version of the phone and it looks very nice to see as well as use. Would definitely recommend this phone if your budget is below 20k.

The Best phone you can have under ₹17,000

  It's my first Samsung Galaxy Smartphone and I am amazed to use it. The Quad camera it has, is one of the finest you can get in this price segment. Even the front camera is also good for a decent performance. Battery is 6000mah which is more than enough for your daily requirements. So you want a long lasting and heavy duty phone this should be your first choice and also by buying this, you are supporting India and enforcing Boycott Chinese Products movement.

  1. First of all let me tell you that previously I have used Xiaomi Mi A12. I'm writing this review after 9 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

  : It takes an extraordinary effort to grab some eyeballs for a Samsung smartphone, if it does not belong to the 'S' or 'Note' family - a feat achieved by Galaxy M30 and M30s last year. The M series was launched as an online-exclusive to compete against Chinese makers like Vivo, Realme and Xiaomi. The most recent smartphone launched under it is the Galaxy M31 which succeeds last year's Galaxy M30s. The latter was one of the best mid-range smartphones of 2019, offering a massive 6000 mAh battery, a feature you also get on the M31.While the new smartphone borrows most of the features from its sibling, it does get some upgrades too, including an extra camera at the back. Samsung hasn't increased the price much with the base model of the Galaxy M31 priced at Rs 14,999 and this itself should attract a few buyers.: It takes an extraordinary effort to grab some eyeballs for a Samsung smartphone, if it does not belong to the 'S' or 'Note' family - a feat achieved by Galaxy M30 and M30s last year.

Worth for the price

  I was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.Camera clarity is good and very good voice clarity of calls.Battery life is only one day for full Internet usage and 3 hours of calls.

A good nice phone in decent price.

  The phone is good so far and I have played games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 for around 1 hr approximately. The phone heats up a bit. Not sure about the heavy gamers as I haven't tried playing for longer duration. Apart from it, no issues with the phone. Happy with the purchase. The front camera and the rear camera are just good and there is no lag in the processing of the photo. There are really good apps preinstalled and customization options in UI. I felt the volume of the speaker is a bit low, however it is just okay. I recommend if you want a nice music playing device, go for a nice speaker to use. It's a good durable phone. Not sure about the heavy gamers as I haven't triend pl

Best mobile in affordable price
",5,"

  The battery life of this product is best so far even with heavy usage and gaming the battery stays for more than a dayCamera quality is amazingIt's not very heavy and has a sleek designSamsung has kept its focus on the cameras as the Galaxy M31 touts a 64MP quad camera setup. Other key Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications include a Super AMOLED display, 6,000mAh battery and Android 10 softwareThe front of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is familiar as well, as you're greeted by a 6.4-inch full HD+ (2,340 x 1,080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, much like its predecessors. The display gets a U-shaped notch up top that houses a selfie camera and a fairly thick chin.Thanks to a glossy rear panel, the Galaxy M31 is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, something which is quite noticeable on the black colour variant that we received for review. Moreover, the rear panel attracts scratches if you place it on a table or in your pocket along with some keys.This mobile is the best in affordable range

Nice samsung camera phone with few heating issues
",5,"

  1) Heating issue can be experienced frequently while using YouTube, downloading, uploading, updates and during charging. Few restrictions of disabling location and background apps when not in use reduces the heating issues.2) huge 6000 Mah battery but backup not up to the mark as it should be. Similar backup in my previous vivo with 3400 mah battery.3) camera 64MP but similar quality pics compared to other 48MP pics of vivo and realme.Except above, the phone is nice and good option if you don't want to purchase Chinese brands as in my case.4) very long charging time more than 2.5 hrs. It should be made fast by samsung.5) should be provided with  in box accessories like screen guard, earphones.6) backcover to be made more attractive and qualityOverall phone is good with nice display, camera features, good pics, good video recording.

  At this range.. overall a good phone, no lagging issues noticeably noticed, camera does fine when mode is changed to 64 mp, battery is the biggest point, with moderate usage it wil last 2 days comfortably, fingerprint sensor also does the job, back panel color combo cud have been an added catch..P.S: Please do not expect the performace of a 49k phone from a 16.5k phone..

But never had issues but with this phone I have to unlearn every android or iOS simplicity. Samsung UI is complex. I just have to ask Google everytime for small things like finger print gestures.All in all I would unlearn everything ahhahahah...thanks samsung!!!!

And that too very useful.5. Battery couldn't be more great. Though it takes time to charge but once charged then it goes all day night long.6. Sound is superb. Speaker are crisp clear audio without any glitch. Call quality is great. I can talk so easily now.7. Dolby Atmos is a charm. Its headphones sound quality is super.8. Camera is great. It captures details. Although its not a dslr but its good.9. Build quality couldn't be better. Gorilla glass makes it more good.Cons:1. Battery charger is very low like 15w which is below market standards.2. Top notch could have been more smaller like a dot display.3. Processer are low end.4. Front camera lacks quality

  I purchased this phone because didn't want to go for a Chinese phone.Another reason, purchase a higher version so that you don't feel more storage/RAM requirement in a year or two.Currently using it for a month now.Cons:Was expecting more battery life from 6000mAh.I don't paly games or watch videos, still battery drains out quickly.There might be few background apps.Samsung has filled the phone with unnecessary (preloaded) apps.Pros:Camera works good in bright light, not that effective in low light.Fingerprint is Ok. Good responsive phone/So far phone doesn't lag.Conclusion:Apart from few above minor issues there's not much to complain.Overall satisfied.

BEST IN CATEGORY BUDGET PHONE WHICH IS NON CHINESE
",5,"

  A marvelous phone at great price which can compete with any phone in its category in all aspects and can beat them hands down. Long battery life to sustain for more than one and a half day, responsive fingerprint reader including retinal scan and a great camera to shoot at various angles.  The nail in the coffin is that its NON CHINESE and this is the minimum we can do to support the cause in such a situation. Only one demerit is that its slightly heavy, may be due to 6000 mah bty. Overall a highly recommended budget phone.

Amazing Phone for Moderate use

  Amazing phone with great experience and value for money. These are my experience based review of the phone.1. Camera: 4.5/5 - With awesome camera it stands above all its competitors and samsungs advance software makes capturing moments super easy.2. Battery life- 4.5/ 5: Completely satisfying battery life with 6k mAh capacity. Moderate use can easily support 24 hrs with still 10-20% bateery remaining.3. Fingerprint sensor- 2.1/5: This is the only area this phone is lagging behind. With relatively slow responses time and sometimes even not detecting fingerprint.4. Display- 3.8/5: with amazing display this phone gives an amazing viewing experience. However, brightness control settings can be improved.5. Processing/ Performance- 3.9/5: Moderate use is completely satifying with no lags but when it comes to high performance like gaming & multi tasking, it can support you even to the edge. Battery life drops significantly to half but it never lags. Apps may open slow but performance is not impacted much.6. Charging - 3.5/5: Although fast charging is there but it takes almost 2-2.5 hrs to get 100% charge. This could be improved in subsequent versions.

Nice phone to own, go for this

  I zeroed on this after consulting many friends suggested it for being value for money. I didn't want to go for Chinese. It's been 20 days since I am using this. I bought high memory phone because every other vendor wants his app installed on your phone.My requirement were for scanning docs, social media,  daily payments & of course calling.Fingerprint reader is not that good. It ask to wipe your finger and try again. My previous Lenovo was far better in this.Battery life is good. I charge it once in 2 days. Charging is fast enough.Camera quality is good. I am not photo enthusiast. Photos are clear enough for my needs.Pros:- Simple looks.- quick responding.- Samsung brand. Made in India!!- screen is 6.4 inches but carrying is easy. Not heavy.Cons:- finger prints not that good. Not better then Lenovo.- still not able to create two user profiles. Lenovo had it very simple.- Casting feature not present in notifications pull down like in Lenovo.- no screen lock and shutdown menu in notification pull down menu.Overall so far so good.

What a long distance runner

  A good phone  if not better  ,at  this price from Samsung which is Made in India . I have ordered this mobile online after reading the reviews but I am  slightly disappointed with the performance .  I'm writing after  3 weeks of usage, andmy experience with m31 has been topsy turvy. However,  I am impressed with the long lasting battery, andslightly disapointed with speed of the processor.  Eventhough , RAM is  6GB.Good:-  comes with Android 10.  looks great.- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. Experienced slight heating issues and also found lagging.- 6000 Mah battery is good enough and is lasting 2 days for me with moderate usage. So, happy with it, but takes about 2 hours or more to fully charge the battery- 128 GB storage is pretty good for regular storage and no need of further ROM.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 20 percent charge. But, Charging took in excess of 2 hours- Mobile speakers sound is ok, but not as loud as , other budget phones of this price range. This is a big let down for me.- Camera is good. Macro performance is very good - daytime pics are good but night photos are a bit worrisome.  A big letdown in this price range, vis a vis , other competitors. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. So, no need to carry a professional camera,  as the day light pics are as good as a pro.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is  good, if not better.- Received after two months of ordering,  due to lock down of covid19Not So Good:- bulky, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung DexFeedback- A bit slippery in hand, dropped twice but lucky recovered without any damage.  No screen guard or gorilla glass. Already, find some scratches after two weeks of continuous usage. Could have been supplied with gorilla glass this price.

  This phone is best when it comes to display and battery, the camera is also awesome and is better compared to its rivals at this price segment. The performance of the phone is nice. One can play games easily in HDR graphics but if one plays for 4-5 hours continuously then a bit throttling can be observed. This is a not a gaming phone but can support casual and heavy games. For normal users this is best phone under 20K. The UI is awesome and has many customisation. The phone is made in india.

  DISLIKES:I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product  Defects:No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:-headphone audioJack not working-caller audio receiver not working-speaker not workingVideos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.LIKES:Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.WHO can Buy:-Camera is priority-Wants some bigger battery-day to day regular usage-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wiselyPHONE WONT' SATISFY:-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.-onscreen finger print sensor-A51Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.For this price,this is a real mega monster.REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's😁

  Well I would like to share my honest review after using it for more than a month. Below are some pros and cons of m311.Battery life is very decent. Last for one day with heavy usage, 1½ day with moderate usage and 2 days with light usage2. Performance is also great. But Snapdragon would have been better as this phone will disappoint you if u play pubg and other high graphics game. If you only use some basic apps for office work or you are a student and use study apps, then absolutely no issue with performance.3. Due to a larger mah battery, it is somewhat heavy, yet bearable.4. Camera quality is decent in day light, with focus mode and video recording is also good, but is disappoints in night light.5. OS is also good, with less ads and high security (one of the perks of being a Samsung mobile user)6. And at last, Super Amoled screen is awrsome, with vivid colours and natural outcast. If you like videos and movies, then you are gonna like it too.Conclusion: overall it is a great product. I would give it 9 points out of 10.

Review from a Non-Gamer
",5,"

  I believe that this is a perfect phone for me. I wanted a phone which had a great battery with a good camera. And this is better than I could have imagined.The battery is just massive. It lasts me easily more than 2 days. Even after the 2nd day it is around 20%. So if you're someone who wants a phone which lasts more than 2 days then go for it.The camera is great too. You have the choice if you want to take pictures in 64 MP or not. As 64MP takes a lot of size.The quality of the pictures are perfect too.As I said I don't play games, so I would not be able to comment on that. But if you're someone who likes to watch videos and use the phone for non-gaming reasons then you cannot ask for a better device.One UI feels good too. Much better than MI and other smartphone's UI.Plus the cherry on top of the cake is that it is not from a Chinese company. So you won't have to feel guilty about that.TLDR: Go for it. It has a great camera, battery, and feels quite premium to me.

  Really I am so impressed with the new Samsung M31 smartphone.I bought it from amazon and delivered it to me within time.Following are the reviews of this smarphones based on thier performance I used it during a month.CAMERA:the quad rear camera is so good.The pictures which is captured is so clear and doesnt even blurred thtough zooming .The video i recorded is also of Full hd quality and seems to be recorded through high pixel digital cameras.DISPLAY:The super amoled display of M31 is also do good.The crystal clear display enables me to use it effectively during bright sunshine unlike other smartphones.BATTERY:The superb 6000 mah battery is so high Even after continuous use of 10 hours the battery drains a little .And fast charging enables this phone to charge fastly .NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:Both sim support 4G connectivity and network strength capacity is also good.FINGERPRINT SENSOR: This phone comes with a rear fingerprint scanner which allows me to unlock my phone less than a second and Face unlock id is also works good.RAM And MEMORY: I bought 6Gb ram and 128 gb storage variant.I have played several games of high quality like Pubg but even not a single glitch observed during gaming.Also multiple apps opening at a same time doesnot hangs my handset.I have not observed any hanging problem until now.SPEAKER:Sound quality is good and so loud such that we are even listen songs in loudspeaker in a huge crowd area.WEIGHT AND DESIGN:This phone weight is not so high even it uses large 6000 mah battery.And I give it 5 star in its design .The large 6.4 inch screen it uses is so nice and I feels it so handy and carriable during walking,jogging or any other travelling.Overall I gave this phone 5 star as it brings my life so easier and all my works which i used to do with laptop is now shifted to my new Samsung M31 smartphone.THANKS TO SAMSUNG AND AMAZON for this great smartphone..

  It's an excellent considering the price and features. The picture quality images taken from both front and back camera is great. The battery easily lasts a day with normal usage. The fingerprint sensor must be covered fully to open it. The main disadvantage is that you have to keep the phone on at night for the alarm to work.

  Best buy for anyone! Price point seems brilliant for all the specs that come with the phone. I have my phone on me 24/7... so I think I can speak for most of the people out there who are looking for a mid priced SMARTphone. Everything has been smooth. Decent display. No lag whatsoever, although, I did have doubts seeing the processor this came with. I still love this phone. Fingerprint reader scans quick and is hassle free. The battery life is amazing. Fully charged, it lasts me a day with heavy use (almost 24hrs). I particularly love how sharply detailed the zoom is on this phone and the macro mode is LOVE. Many more modes which I didn't particularly use but looked good on just my first try like the slow mo and a mode just for food pics! You've got a lot of features that you'd get on expensive phones like the A series and I've only mentioned what I love the most here. Go for the M31 for the Quad cam and the monster battery life. The space black color option looks pretty cool and sleek. Not disappointed.. yet? No regrets🤩

Best Choice under 20k.

  Camera - Amazing; hyperlapse, slow motion, wide screen view etc functions really well.Fingerprint Scanner - incredibly Fast; works all the time.Battery backup - Pretty good.. I mean I use my phone for almost 12-14 hours in a day (almost continuously) and I just charged it overnight and it lasted through the entire day, (without any further charging).Face Scanner - It is a little slow (but that is, as mentioned, in order to increase security) ... But sometimes it fails to recognise.Gaming - Light gaming (i.e. small games of upto 100mb) is absolutely fine; no lagging, no heating. Can't give any opinions about heavy gaming (like pubg etc) since I don't play.Additionally, I have been using this phone for 2 days now. As of yet, there has been no heating/lagging while using Instagram Reels/Boomerang or Snapchat Camera (which was not the case for my previous phone)In a nutshell, it's definitely one of the best mobile device you can buy under 20k. Highly functional and extremely useful.

  I bought 6+128gb version on offer. I always wanted a phone which had a very good battery and this phone didn't disappoint me. It's 64mp camera is best in its class. I am satisfied with the phone. It doesn't have constant ads like xiomi or any other brands and it's User interface is very smooth. Fingerprint sensor is fast and exynos didn't disappoint me either. It's pretty fast. If you want to buy a made in India smartphone which in it's production have given some jobs to our countrymen then go for it else choose some Chinese brand who is just assembled in India and doesn't add to our GDP. One big factor why i bought it is because of availabilty of its geniune spare parts.

If you already have Samsung phone you can easily transfer everything through samsung smart switch feature.Battery holds good if you don't use this phone as hotspot all the time.Touch sensors are good and speakers are fine.Do not have any complaints so far except keyboard input seems lags at time hopefully some updates in future fixes it.15k worth mobile n its worth it!!

  An amazingly affordable and gorgeous appearing technology with high definition quad camera , battery life and unbelievable storage space. 🥰🥰The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you.There are few reasons to buy this phone, but to be fair, they are good ones. The OLED display is fantastic, as is the battery life. Performance is adequate for day-to-day tasks, and as long as you don't intend to game much, there's really no reason not to pick up this phone, other than camera performance, that is.Descriptions: Samsung Galaxy M31 128GB smartphone runs on Android v10 (Q) operating system. The phone is powered by Octa core (2.3 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A73 + 1.7 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A53) processor. It runs on the Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 Chipset.

Overall a good product in budget
",4,"

  2nd review(5months use):  Everything is fine except battery. I think currently my phones battery only has 60% of it's initial capacity as battery draining has almost doubled even if you do nothing. If you just leave the phone overnight without any background app open, it drains 5-8% battery in just 8 hours. Which is quite disappointing. Though good product in budget.  1st review(3month use):  I would suggest buying this to other customers as till now, it's been 3 months I have this phone, and I'm using this phone for gaming purpose each and everyday for at least 3hours per day, but still battery survives for around 48 hours. So no doubt battery is really good. But day by day it's getting weaker I think. While playing PUBG Mobile default settings, battery drains faster than other games and app.I have no complaints on display.Camera is not as good as expected from a 64MP primary camera, but that Slow Motion and other camera features are good and enjoyable.Processor is OKAY for me, as I do use HD graphics and High framerate by default in PUBG Mobile, and it runs smooth. I'm not going to higher those graphics as I'm no professional gamer and and graphics looks smooth for me. For simple use and for free time gamers like me, think this phone is perfect.

A good deal at an Economical cost

  Samsung M31 mobile has got great picture & sound quality, also the videos made by this phone are crystal clear. It's battery also gets charged in a short time & after charging once, the battery remains charged for two days continuously. There are inbuilt apps like Google calendar, Google photos, Google maps, Netflix, Google photos & you tube, which are very useful. It's far better than my previous smartphone Lenovo K6 power, in terms of storage space and battery life.

  1. CAMERA , quality is just ok when I compare with same prise phone like MI. They need to improve it.Macro shots are fine.2. Finger prints scanner, I will say much improved from previous samsung phones. But still sometime its not able to read so quickly.3.Battery, this is good part. Once fully charge it keep going for long time. But bad part is its charger. It take too long to charge full.4. Space , no problem5, good non china phone... :)

  The camera a above decent, it gets nice picture when given proper light. Took videos as well bt for slow motion videos u need natural light, the camera app won't trigger slow motion under low light. Having said that, the pictures are too good given the price range.Coming to battery! U can easily stretch 2 days wid average use, even with battery below 20 percent u can easily game for 1-2 hrs (personal exp). Its a beast when it comes to battery, the only con is the amount of time it takes to charge.The fingerprint reader acts fast bt due to flat nature with the back of tge phone it gets difficult to locate, if ur using a case then no problems. But wid no case u have to locate fingerprint reader, a slight curve wud have been great!Rest I have been using the phone for more than 1 month and d phone fell for more that 7 times bt till now the front screen is intact. There are scratches on the back bt build quality in terms of front glass is awesome.I would suggest any1 to buy!

Initial impressions and basic user review of Samsung M31
",5,"

  I bought the black 6GB/128GB variant a week ago and have been using this phone ever since. I'm happy with its performance in general, so far.Few things which I feel require a quick mention:1. Battery - Although the phone has a fast charging capability, my device takes roughly between 1.5 to 2.5 hours to completely charge, which is a bit disappointing, but the battery lasts easily for 24 hours so that's okay. Still disappointed about the slow charging bit.2. Camera - The primary camera performs best in an outdoor lighting condition with a fairly decent color reproduction. The EIS for 1080p videos is good. The front-faced camera captures good pictures and records video decently in indoor lighting conditions. Didn't get to check it in an outdoor condition.3. Other features - The build quality looks premium. The volume and the power buttons appears to be of good quality. The finger print sensor has a quick response time which is great. The touchscreen quality is indeed good. The OS operates well, I haven't noticed any lag so far. The dark mode is a welcome addition to this phone. Call quality is very good. The speakers are fairly loud given there's only 1 speaker grill at the bottom.Overall, in my opinion M31 is a value for money phone from Samsung.

Mega monster?🤔

  Its been 20 days since I'm using M31 and I have found some issues with this so called 'mega monster'.Even after having 6gb ram it hangs atleast once in a day.Heats up in normal usage too.Fingerprint sensor is slow. Battery backup is not soo highlighting.Display is breath taking and sound quality is good.Eventhough the back is made of plastic, it looks good(In many reviews it is said that this phone doesnt look premium).Smudges very easily.Camera quality is awesome.Charging takes more than 150 minutes to be full.Overall it is a bugdet phone but little over priced.Last but not the least...the packing was too bad.My heart skipped a beat when i saw the way it was packed and send.Just a 2 mm cardboard packing.Having or not having an extra outer Amazon packing would not create any difference in this case.

  Where should I start...just awesome,this is the best mobile under 20k,I was confused if I should buy this or Redmi note 9 pro,but finally decided to proceed with this one,the rear camera is like outstanding and the macro mode is really great,the battery power is just perfect to stay like non stop gaming,and u can have bunch of selfies and apps as the space is really never ending,though sometimes (like 2 or 3 days in a month ) it was changed for couple of minutes but after the software update it is smooth as butter,the selfie camera is also great like 4.5 out of 5 and lastly it is really handy and display is top notch,also it has lower ray display so yea good for eyes also,just go and buy thisssss,enjoy your time.

  I have moved down from note 8 which i bought for 64 thousand 2 years back, from amazon. I purchased this for 16 thousand. I was expecting a major downgrade but i am happy to share that the user experience is just as good. The battery impresse me and i am astounded that samsung delivered the same screen quality that i had on the note 8. Camera is decent but i am comparing it to a note so my expectations are high. The weight distribution is so good that it feels much better to hold than to hold a note 8. I have used it tocplay call of duty mobile and it works well with medium settings.I dont think you can get better value for money at this price and that too with service support of a behemoth like samsung.

  I came to Samsung galaxy M31 straight from using Samsung J7 pro in few days, so it felt like shedding an extra layer of skin which is lighter and more manageable with a soft touch over its screen. Its extremely well balanced and easy to hold and navigate with one hand. Display which feels like absolute best of all words - beautiful colors, perfect viewing angles, incredible 6000mAh battery etc. I would recommend trying both and seeing whether usage allows you to maintain a high fresh rate because its absolutely worth it.

  Samsung phones essentially have the best price-to-feature ratio. The surprise factor with the Samsung M31 is the camera. It is absolutely amazing. The picture quality is just too good. In any mode, it is stunning. And then the other features, be it the battery life, the sound quality, the video quality, or the processing speed, are at par with the best. I dont think that at this price point, any other company can pack in even half the features. Buying this phone is an absolute no-brainer.

One of the Best Mid Range Beast
",5,"

  Been using this for over a week now.1.I am a average user who use whats app, fb, twitter, Instagram, gmail etc using Bluetooth for audio for about 1 hour, got SOT on my 1st Charge for 10 hours + and i was amazed.... So from the battery from you really wont have to worry even being a heavy user it will definitely support for a full day.2. Charging take about 2.5 hours which is ok considering the battery size but would have preferred if the phone supported higher watt charging, customer could have opted for high wattage adaptor at an additional cost.3. Using a 6GB RAM version multi tasking has been smooth.4. Amoled Display has been really sharp and the touch complements it perfectly.5. Camera is good enough for the price paid. Day light photos a good if you better than switch to 64MP only and compromise the wide angle. Night Mode is fair, i would prefer using flash mode.6. Price for this beast is just right considering the GST increase but below 15k would have been perfects.

The phone never really hangs and its always smooth, thanks to 6GB RAMDISADVANTAGES:1. If would have been better if more freedom was given in manual camera mode(e.g shutter speed)2.And the in the back cover, the fingerprints will be visible,so it looks lil messy.(for jet black)

  Have been looking for a budget phone under 20k and M31 ticked all the positive marks for being the all-rounder I was looking for.Camera quality is great. There'sa slight learning curve to get the most out of it's quad camera system. There are many features to explore in the camera software.As far as bloatware are concerned, I haven't seen any intrusive bloatware or ads. In fact, it has the cleanest UI with no compromises in terms of privacy and security.Battery life is really good. Charged 100% tgis morning 6 am and since then using it (writing this review at 7:30pm and it still has 57% battery) for photography and video making.The processor coupled with 6GB RAM + 128GB storage makes it surprisingly fast.Overall, this is a great phone for any one looking value for money.A lot better than smartphones from rivals like OnePlus, Huawei, Xiaomi, Realme, and Vivo.GO FOR IT...

I am little disappointed from this phone was quality of super stady, slow motion and super slow motion video because whenever u turn on this feature the video quality was down from actual quality. Slow motion and super slow motion functions are not good for night videography. I found face unlock was quite working slow at night.

  •This is a picture of a painting drawn by me and clicked by the new m31. The camera is so good, you can yourself look at the beautiful colours and details captured.•The battery is 6000mah which is huge but personally since I am a very heavy user it doesn't lasts for more than a day.•The phone has the normal Samsung theme structure with options of course. But the basic user feeling is the same (as I have been a Samsung user since last 2 years).•The phone looks beautiful but a little chunky and heavy. That is obviously because of the huge battery. But the weight distribution is done well hence you won't feel the weight.•The camera is terrific with amazing features. You have slo-motion in the front camera as well. Not only the rear camera but the front camera is also very sharp with beautiful colours.•Its been a few days since I am using this phone and by far I have experienced no lags and the phone works fine.

Its camera is really one of the best.Its better to buy Samsung galaxy M31,M21, M30s than buying higher budget phones of samsung and other companies because nowadays each and everyone of us change their phones after 3 to 4 years.And for the users who have their work continuously for a day should buy this phone,my suggestion.

  Can be consider as the best smartphone in the budget range section.Fingerprint reader works really well even when your hands are Sweety or wet.Battery life is quite good as the smartphone have a mega 6000 MAh battery but the optimization is not that well, the battery drains quite well, if you use your phone for long time like me use your phone in power mode as it give more battery life.The 5 camers(4 rear and 1 front) are awesome the quilty is quite good even in low light, the video have a option of stabilization which give great stabilization even if you shake your phone but at the same time decrease the quality. The UHD mode gives you 4k recording.The display is so bright and vivid, the display shows you good color, the black are more black and white are more whiter. You can actually see the color diffrence on the screen. So, if you consume more and more HD content this phone can be really good.

  A good phone in this price range. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery is getting a bit hot while using hotspot and calling simultaneously. Battery is good, but charging is not so fast. Camera is good, low light photography is very good. Front camera is also good with screen flash. Face unlock is not too intelligent to detect face always. Fingerprint reader is not very fast but manageable. Look is not very impressive. Glossy back cover easily gets dirty by fingerprints. However, it will score 7.5 to 8 in a scale of 10.

  I am writing this review after using the phone for a week.I had very clear expectations and idea about what I want and till now I am extremely happy that this phone has ticked all the boxes. I am a heavy user with about three hours talk time, another two hours using the phone as my tab, checking mails and working on other apps. Besides this I listen to music and an episode of a web series and checking  faebook. All these put together, the battery lasted for more than one and half day. Moreover, even with a 6000 mAh battery, this phone looks surprisingly small and light.Next comes the display which is Samsung's forte and it is stunning aa ever. The black is black and the colours are brilliant.Camera is quite good. I recorded a dance performance of about 5 minutes which has come out very well with all details. However, low light performance is not the best. Overall, camera performance will get a very good from me.Navigation is easy though I like stock android more.However, this is not the fastest phone. Exinose 9611 is an old processor and even with 8GB ram ( I have two M 31) the speed of multitasking is moderate. But, that is sufficient for me since I am not a heavy gamer. And at this price range, I think it gives more than enough.However, one thing of this phone which is really annoying is the length of the charger chord. I have not come across such a short chord in any phone. It is barely 2 ft and you have to keep the phone very close to the charging point which at many times is not possible and hence becomes a real challengeOverall, I am very satisfied till now. My last phone was Nokia 7 plus and this NEW is definitely scores over that by a good length. In fact, this better than Redmi Note 9 which is driven by SD720.. A great value for money.

Truely a mega monster

  Samsung has made a significant improvements in its low budges smartphones thanks to the healthy competition by all other counterpart smartphone  makers. I have been using the phone for almost 2 months now, it is going absolutely fine. The most eye catching element in that phone is its 6.4 inches SAMOLED infinity U display which enables you to watch high resolution videos and movies a genuine  pleasure. The details, colour generation and the vibrancy of the colours are truely soothing to eyes. Apart from that it comes with Samsung EXYNOS octacore processor accompanied with a 6 GB DDR4 ram which does a decent job, for normal user it works absolutely  fine and if you are into high end games then it might not be the best option. In addition , it has a moster battery capability with 6000mah battery it covers the entire day pretty smoothly eventhough  it has been used quite rigorously,  that inclues browsing internet heavily, watching 1080p videos on youtube, talking throuh video calls so on and so forth. It also supports dual 4g sim simultaneously that means you can use 2 4g sims with LTE option on at the sam time. Cameras  are also does a decent job, which comes with 64 Mega Pixels primary camera along with 3 other cameras for depth and other functionality, its  front camera is of 32 Mega Pixels which performs pretty nicely. There are few drawbacks in that phone and they are its back is made of plastic which could have been replaced by metallic materials and looks of the phone could have been beautified 10 times of it has been given. Another cons I would say its camera inspite of having 64 megapixels in low light its performance drops a little. That's is all about the phone . Overall, it is a good purchase considering the price bracket which is under 18k and it also comes with exchange option.

  Update as per 11 April 2020 SW update fail:-I want to say that it's a good phone...however Co. needs to build on handling its own the software glitches unlike many phones such that if SW update fails, phone automatically restores itself to operable state.The issue with me - a system update made the phone dead and now I want to return the product and buy a different Samsung phone given the lockdown situation in the country and all its service centres closed.Please suggest what should be done?Updated review post SW recovery :- stars updated from 3 to 4.The samsung team responded well and recovery of my dead phone was made possible. Phone is working pretty ok since then except the battery unit in it. The battery efficiency has fallen since then.Had the problem not happened, this phone deserved a generous 5 star. 👍Update as on June 2, 2020:-Pretty satisfied with its performance. Very dependable phone. The display quality is top notch. Camera is awesome. Hands-on feel of the phone is pretty premium at this price point. File transfers are smooth across other devices. I am very much satisfied with this Samsung unit especially when it faced such an issue before. What more to go well down with such an awesome device alongwith a super prompt customer service.Must go for this!!👍 RECOMMEND.. RECOMMEND.. RECOMMEND..I was an Mi user before Samsung and trust me on this that THIS PHONE BEATS MI IN EVERY DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF QUALITY. Go Ahead Guys !!

  Phone comes with good specifications. However Samsung does not offers snapdragon in Indian market even for flagship phones.. That's shocking. Exynos is thier in house developed chipset. Pathetic performance with the same

The MONSTROUS M31
",5,"

  My review comes after a 15 day use with the M31.The features offered by this phone at this range is really astonishing.Let it be the monstrous 6000mAh battery or the clean One UI or the Processor.I was a bit confused at first with the Processor as I felt Snapdragon offered by other manufacturers had an upper hand over the Exynos, but I am clearly mistaken as the performance of Exynos is on par with a 7 series Snapdragon (Exynos might even be better than Snapdragon).I have not faced any kinds of issues with high end gaming or continous usage.The next big thing about this phone is the Battery, the 6000mAh battery is actually the real deal.Under heavy usage I have got a battery backup of nearly 18hours.Even with the monstrous battery the phone is lightweight and easy to carry.Samsung has offered decent 64mp quad back camera which also houses an 8mp wide camera and a 32 mp front camera.In my personal opinion the M31 camera stands ahead when compared with its competitor Motorola Fusion.The fingerprint sensors are backmounted instead of inscreen unlike the new normal.The backmounted fingerprint sensor seems to be faster than the inscreen fingerprint sensors provided on the Samsung A70 smartphone.But at times I have faced issues with slow detection on my M31.Disregarding this small problem the M31 is the perfect budget phone currently in the market.I as a customer of Samsung highly recommend you to purchase this mobile phone.Worth every penny.

  Hope it's a wonderful mobile with great featuresI am writing this review after testing it in so many aspectsThe battery was good 6000mah  From 100 to 81 percentage for 4 hour 30  minute zoom class.  From 100 to 78 percentage for playing call  of duty game for 2 hour 45 minutes.  Other astonishing thing about the battery  is what ever is the battery percentage at  night while sleeping 9:30 it is the same  at morning 7:30 that is at night the  charging was 69 percentage at the  morning also the charging was 69  percentage.its the thing i love.Now lets talk about processor  Most of the people tell others that  exynos processes are bad but believe  me exynos processors are good in  Samsung mobiles. They have good  Optimisation in Samsung mobiles. this  is  the thing I love because this mobile  has exynos 9611 Octa Core processor.  Which is even for better than  Snapdragon 855 processor so we can  estimate that the processor is good and  we can have it for a good gaming and  better coding also the processor is  outstanding.Now let's talk about the RAM  The mobile comes with 6gb RAM with  having outstanding performance where  we can do anything most easilyNow let's talk about the internal memory  the internal memory is huge which is  128 GB it is far more enough for many  people. Even the mobile is expandable  upto 512 GB. which is huge even betterNow let's talk about the camera  Telling about it camera has various  modes. The front camera is 32 MP which  is more than enough for most of us. Here  there are 4 back cameras 64mp main  camera with 8mp Ultra wide camera and  5 MP depth camera and 5mp macro  camera. There are various option cameras  in various mode for shooting methods it  has even a macro camera which is suitable  for seeing things which are not visible to  our naked eyes and even for a better  photography the mobile is useful.Now let's see about the screen  The mobile comes with a 6.4 inch that is  64.21 cm super amoled infinity u cut  display.The thing I love is it has blue light  filter so that our eyes can be protected.  so there is no fear of eyesite using this  mobile for hours.Now let's talk about the Android version  The mobile comes up with an Android  version 10 and Samsung company is  improving on the mobile to go to  Android version 11 and here comes the  Android version may be upgraded for  next two years also.Now let's talk about the fingerprint  The fingerprint is superb and ultrafastNow finally let's come to a conclusion about this mobile the service of Amazon is very good and the service of Samsung company is also good as if we can see service centres at places across India. It is wonderful mobile which comes at 17.5 kI suggest for people who are buying mobiles under 20k it is a best option.

Best smartphone I ever saw,

  I bought SAMSUNG M31 (6GB/128GB) Space Black varient.I must say It's a best budget smartphone and moreover its and Indian smartphone which is made in india as well as manufactured in india so this phone can become the priority for those who wants to buy only an Indian smartphone.Talking about the camera,The 64MP rear camera capture the perfect picture as you want to capture and the detail are so accurate , macro lens is also great to access and one can enjoy it if they love to capture nature scenery with  closeup. The video stabilization is very well and performance is excellent moreover there is a inbuilt AR ( Augmented reality) creation system which give you and creative mindset to draw any feature along with recording live. The Screen response is very fast and you can travel from app to app with ease. Screen display is very well protected with 3 layer of gorilla glass and the picture quality is outstanding. Its processor is one of the best processor to play high graphic game like PUBG, Fortnite , Free Fire , Call Of Duty etc. Gamers will love this smartphone. Speaker are very loud and accurate and one of the feature named as 'DOLBY ATMOS' give you out of the space music experience because it make the music in 4D type  I mean the music seem to be roaming behind us from left  to right which give an extraordinary experience for music Lover. Coming toward the feature , I have never seen this type of AI ( Artificial intelligence) features in other smartphones, the pop-up view, AR Drawing pad, Bixby vision, Smart Switch, Dark mode etc. Battery life is very long and it comes with 6000mAh battery along with 15W charger and charging cable is of good quality. The fingerprint reader is accurate and very useful feature because it also help you to fall down the notification pannel which is and effortless feature.I am Loving this Smartphone. And I Guarantee you that you will also Love this phone.I totally recommend this smartphone because it is one of the best budget smartphone with all in pack and one should have this smartphone.

  Though I am very skeptical about smartphones still I liked this Galaxy M31device very much. Here is my brief review about cam, battery, processor, ram and storage.#Camera quality is great (the best in this price range) in daylight. Low light capturing is also good, but not very good. You may find little noise while taking photos in low light (specially indoors). I expected a bit better. Full hd video recording feature with both the rear and selfie camera is a great added feature. Specially new youtube vloggers. 64mp main, wide angle, macro overall a well crafted cam setup. Depth sensor is also good with new options. But while taking protrait mode (live focus mode in this case) finishing of the blurry edges could have been better.#Battery is damn good and it does what it says (in the ads). If you are not a heavy user u can easliy survive one day and a half (even 2days, depends upon your usage) without charging.. if you play games like pubg, free fire frequently you will get a whole day with single charge for sure. And no heating issues at all.#Proccessor is wellcrafted for multitasking and with the support of 6gb #RAM it is great. Your regular work, social media, internet surfing, live streaming, movie watching, music and gaming will go very soomthly without any lag. But if you play high end graphic games or games like pubg with full graphics, after an hour or so you will see drop in the frame rates. Otherwise overall experience is good.#Massive #storage of 128gb is definitely a feature liked by all no doubt.  And you can easily upgrade it to more by simply adding a sd card in the dedicated sd card slot.As per my view, go for Samsung Galaxy M31..you wont regret it. 😊

  Another good mobile from Samsung.It is must now to support Non Chinese Mobile brands at any cost. Double standards while purchasing Chinese brands can only harm our country.Pros - SAmoled display is notch above- Touch is very responsive- Looks of mobile are good- Battery performance is goodCons :-- Camera performance is not up to mark.Front Camera is not producing  good photos.Rear Camera  is not performing well in Night conditions.Hope that Updates by Samsung for Cameras will definitely improve it.

  Here is The Review of my New M31 Samsung Galaxy Phone with 6 GB Ram and 128 GB Storage. As i m owner of CSC and having BC Point. I need phone with more data storage and fast Processor. So i bought Samsung M31 phone. It has most big advantage of having 6000 MaH Battrey which gives longer time to talk and to manage all things. Secondary thing is about storage, it also had more space for downloading big movies, songs and other documents. I love this phone also bcoz it has a feature of Dual VOLTE, which provides unlimited connectivity which means we can use Both Networks on 4G. For me i m satisfied with overall performance of this phone. So i m refering All to buy a best Samsung Galaxy S31.

Extraordinary, awesome, excellent, wonderful, just too good...

  Writting this review after 12 days of usage. So let's start with unboxing it. Just when you open the box and touch the phone you will feel the premium handset.Next display, it's a full HD+ super Amoled display with stunning colourful looks that soothes your eyes.Now come to the important point, battery backup, it's a 6000 mah battery designed to last at least 3 to 4 days (it lasted 5 days also) with normal usage but no gaming or little internet download. Now if you are a heavy user, then this phone will give you 1 to 2 days battery backup. Actually myself sometimes forget when did I charge my phone last time.Now processor, it's Exynos 9611 with 2.3 GHz primary clock frequency & 1.7 GHz secondary clock frequency gives excellent processing speed, you can play PUBG also, but may not be in high definition. But still I say it runs game superb.Now the awesome 64 MP quad rear camera with LED flash, Auto focus, AI mode, beautification & 32 MP front camera with screen flash just makes your pictures look even more beautiful than you can expect.Finally Samsung offering Android 10 with super graphics experience that you will fall in love with it.The only thing is that Samsung need to switch to Snapdragon or Kirin processor though Exynos series are now competing with those two easily I think.I bought the 6GB RAM & 64 GB storage model with price Rs. 15999/-I suggest everyone to go for it without hesitation, but follow my price which I mentioned above.It's an awesome, brilliant, superb, excellent, wonderful, stunning mobile with a premium look. Actually my adjectives are running short to describe the model.Just too good...just wow...... 💖😍❤️💙💜

Deserves the investment..!!

  Giving a review after 5 months of heavy usage so worth reading.Pros-1. Unlike every other Samsung phone which is not apt for gaming , this is the one friend. Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.Cons-1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.Conclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.You will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.

Good Value for the Money purchase

  Good Value for the Money purchase, not facing any issues so far. Experience so far is as good as what described about the model by Samsung. Bought for my son, and impressive for him.Only thing that he did not like is the back of the mobile, there is a barcode slip pasted. I am not sure why it had to be pasted there, it could be on the inside of the box instead. This was little irritating as one cannot use without a protective cover, looks awkward like wearing a shirt with price tag on.

  I have been using this phone for almost 50 days now.Here's my Brief Review of My Galaxy M31:1. The Battery Life on screen time is about 11-12 hours and it can last till 1.5 days if you are a moderate user and a day if you are a heavy user.2. The Charging time to Charge this 6000 mah powerhouse is about 160 minutes.3. The Super Amoled screen display is supreme and delivers excellent video quality.4. The Camera also is quite nice and pixel quality is neat and, Front Facing Camera is Really Excellent, as per my experience.5. The Audio cellular quality is also appropriately nice and Speakers are loud enough to talk on video or audio calls without any Earphones too.6. The Processor needs to be improved in order to optimise the CPU, Battery and GPU Performance.7. The Security Updates are regular and would be monthly available for next 3 years as per Samsung.8. Fingerprint Scanner was also very fast and Face Unlock feature works pretty well too.I would give this phone 8.5/10.(1.5 points deducted for its exynos GPU and, Charger could have been 25-30 watts at this price point)Hope you all liked my Honest Review!P.s: I am not a Gamer hence, i loved this phone.But, i tried Asphalt 9 only once to test performance. And i faced a very very minute lag.If you are a Gamer, there may be a lag but, very minute.

Best Budget Phone

  This phone is worth buying. I will list pros and cons.Here are the pros:1. The very first thing to mention is the camera setup. The image quality is too good in this price range. Both front and rear camera can shoot FHD videos with slomo videos as well. The 64MP shooter does satisfying job.2. Second thing where samsung never disappoints is the 6.4 inches super AMOLED screen which is the best. The colors are very natural and prominent.3. The huge battery is far away from other phone which has endurance of around 1 and half days even after heavy use.4. The exynos 9611 works well for daily use.5. The phone is not at all heavy even if it has huge battery. The weight balance of this phone is great. Thumbs up for that.6. The One UI is the best. It gives a smooth experience on top of android 10.7. Physical fingerprint and face unlock both are fast.Here are the cons:1. First thing, I dont know why samsung is putting the same processor in all of their mid rangers. Though Exynos 9611 does a good job of daily use. But it will disappoint heavy users.2. The macro camera works good in better light conditions, though it is just to attract the customers.3. I have seen some glitches while switching apps. Hopefully samsung will take care of it in sytem updates.4. The speaker is decent but it gets covered while using phone and you may face problems while playing media.5. The deisgn of this phone is not eyecatching but its definitely not bad as reviewers tell.6. Samsung could have provided at least 25W charger. Charging speed is slow but its always a trade-off about what you need.

  The phone is amazing as its band name said it self i.e. "" SAMSUNG "". Camera quality Amazing... Sounds quality  also very good and touch, fingerprint sensor, face recognition and other services are too good.One thing which i most  like is "" Super Amoled Display""... Too...too... good ... and no harm for our eyes.Some functions which  i dislike is that too least option  for gesture and motion.Also No notification light...it provides sound instead of notification  light..but i don't like it. Also you don't  provide a earphone. I want  the Samsung Earphone  for its too good sound quality. Some app in my phone doesn't work properly like WhatsApp..message couldn't  send immediately... take a too long time.. i know that it will be a network problem... but i check it properly... no network  problem.. also chrome  not updated if i want  to update it..other google app update  but chrome doesn't.. So i don't like it...Any other functions  for data saving ... Amazing.. Camera Result Amazing...no words for describe  it... All over the phone is too much better than others..

  ● I loved the camera of my Samsung Galaxy M31, I got this device on August 8th 2020, and using since then...1. Main camera - Best in class.2. Wide camera - no competition at this price.3. Depth sensor - works great 99% of time.4. Macro camera - details are good but theres not much usability because of lack of autofocus.5. Front camera - Again great, clicks amazing pictures,  live focus works in almost every condition where there is decent lighting.● Battery life is better than any phone at this price point.● Finger print reader is really fast, even works with slightly wet fingers.● processor (soc) - Exynos 9611 is very good CPU for daily usage, but if you are buying this for gaming then please refrain from buying this phone, not that good gaming performance compared to other phones at this price point.● 6 GB RAM is more than enough for any work you do in this phone... app reset in backgrounds in very rare because of huge RAM size...● AND MAIN FOCUS - THE AMOLED DISPLAY - the display is simply gorgeous... pixel density is great, watching HD or 4K movies is very pleasing in this display...I would rate 4.8/5 stars, I would recommend this phone to everyone who isn't a 'Hardcore Gamer'.... This phone just satisfy all my needs...

  I have used this phone for about two weeks now.I'm so in love with this phone.PROS1. The battery life is amazing, it has a wonderful standby time.2. Camera is wonderful. The 64mp gives an good finish in the photos.3. The screen is the main plus on this phone, the super AMOLED is good, even if the refresh rate is 60hz it gives a good experience while using.4. Even with 6000amh battery & phone weight of 191grams, the weight is evenly distributed and very comfortable to use.5. The phone comes with a SAMSUNG's own user interface ONE UI 2.0, it gives a premium experience for the user.6. Widevine certification is for this phone.CONS1. There's only 15watts charger given with the phone. 25watts could have be so good(25watts is available in M31s), it roughly take around 2hr 45mins. To get 0% to 100%.2. The processor is Exynos 9611 which is a powerful processor for daily usage. Heavy Gaming with this processor is not advisable. High resolution games are not recommended.3. Low light pictures are average, SAMSUNG should work on that.4. M31 doesn't come with headset or back cover. I paid 17.5k for the phone, I was little bit disappointed when both cover & headset are not includedI will definitely recommend people to buy this phone.

   Honesty saying I'm totally satisfied and happy with this one. All in all everything is great, the interface, the display and the battery is to die for, and as for the camera the video and picture quality is also great, it lags only when it comes to night camera as it takes a bit of time to getting used to, like initially I thought the night photos looked like some oil pastel painting but now after the update and some use it's better. The features are very nice too.I also used redmi 9 pro max as I ordered that one before so I can say that I've had the opposite to compare both and I found the samsung m31 a lot more better than the redmi set which had some heating issues and some kind of camera launching issue.The super amoled display is awesome, it is a very good looking smart phone, the battery can last up upto 36 to 40 hours and it takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to charge completely from zero to hunder. The camera quality is also very good and have many additional available options and features.The processor is very efficient as I've played many games without facing any lag or problem, also I binge watch for long hours and the experience is great.

Good Budget Phone
",5,"

  Pretty Decent features in a reasonable price range...Camera is good but not exceptional, don't expect iPhone X clarity n crispiness as this is a budget phone.. Battery backup is great as expected with a 6000mh battery.Only flaw I can point out is, the term fast charging associated with this fone Charging time varies between 4=5hrs for a full charge which is not expected

Happy with what I have.

  When I was looking to upgrade from my old phone I was essentially looking for something that went along the lines of long term usage, good battery life, big storage, a decent ram speed and most of all a decent camera quality; I was looking for all of that in a mid range phone, I am a loyal Samsung customer but in the last couple of years the product was a bit disappointing so I kept myself away from it as much as I could..But when I read through the reviews and test videos for this phone I had no doubt about what my next purchase would be and I bought it after weeks and comparing and checking out other stuff and I am so happy that I decided on this to be my phone.. Let's start with the following.Battery : with 6000mh battery my days off worrying about low battery life is now all in the past, with minimal usage I easily get about 2 days of work done on my phone but if I am gaming then it's easily a day and a half to dot and that makes me a happy woman, the only thing that comes with a battery that big is it makes the phone a bit heavy but that's okay.Camera: the picture quality is quite good for a phone at this range and even with moderate lighting the phone does a wonderful job helping you with those aspects, since I do a lot of video calling with it helps good with those aspects.Graphics, storage and speed: it's fast, it's big with 128gb internal storage and 6gb ram space this phone gives me enough storage and functionality speed I need to do my day to day work on the phone without worrying about any lags on things, which for a mid range phone is very impressive.Yes it has a headphone jack but the package doesn't come with a pair of ear phones that most previous phones came with but if you already have a existing ear phones that work then you don't need to worry.Fast charge that charges you phone to full capacity within 2 and a half hours is lifesaver, I still don't know if wireless charging is a possibility but I am happy with what I have right nowOver all, I am really happy with the product I've purchased

  What I didn't like is-Cons-1) because of the big screen to body ratio, it is hard to hold the phone without activating any functions near the screen edges.Pros-1) first time after old Nokia feature phone days I am charging the phone only twice a week.2) Super AMOLED display is really crisp and efficient3) smooth running, smooth charging4) no heating up.5) good camera features

  After almost a month of standard use. I must say I am happy with the battery life, it lasts almost two days. The touch is butter smooth. A good and bright display. The finger print is super fast. The camera quality could have been better, not happy with it. As I owned a Lumia 950 earlier, I still feel the display and camera of Lumia is better than this one.

Must read before buying. In depth review of Samsung Galaxy M31.
",5,"

  Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it's M series of smartphones.Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.Rating: 5 of 5.Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.Rating: 5 of 5Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it's awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that's normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it's ok at this price point.Rating: 5 of 5Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.Sound: 4 of 5Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can't be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.Rating: 4 of 5.Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word ""Excellent"". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.Rating: 5 of 5Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.Rating: 5/5Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.

A good, well featured phone with regular samsung cons!

  Well. The phone is pretty  slick. With the first week of usage,  some of the things i have seen1. Fast charging is excellent. Battery charged from 0 to 100% in about 75-80 min. Lasts about 1.5-2 days2. Camera is good. I'm not a heavy user of cameras but found the captures are good quality. Obviously lots of features to explore3. Dobly  sounds makes a difference and is evident.so that's a plus.4. A lot of pre loaded apps. A good 3 GB gets consumed with regular apps like Netflix,  Amazon and stuff.5. Spend time on optimising apps in terms of battery usage  and permissions.6. I was previously  using a phone which had the fingerprint sensor in front.  Somehow find sensor behind a little cumbersomeOverall,  a good phone in the budget range

Now comming to the screen, the phone comes with FHD 6.4"" super AMOLED infinity display  with infinity-U cut this is a full HD display with amazing screen quality.Internals:It works on 1UI version2 i.e. Android 10With Exynos 9611 octacore processor with10nm.Finally 6000mAh battery USB-C Port and Samsung's 15Watt adaptive fast charging

   Received my phone on 5th March 2020. Same day delivery provided by Amazon. I am using this phone for the last 3 months. I selected this phone for the battery backup 6000mAh and internal memory 128GB. I am happy as the phone performs well in these requirements. Please note that the network signal is not good at my office location and naturally phone would get discharge very fast. After full charge at 08:00 AM my phone battery capacity is showing at 47% at 11:00 PM at night. 64 mega pixel quad Camera at rear side. Picture quality is good. We can adjust the brightness while taking photos. Wide lens option for group photos is quite useful. Slow motion and super slow motion options are available. Fingerprint sensor is fast. On the box ""made in India"" label is printed and I feel proud. Arogyasetu app is running with bluetooth on 24X7. Ear phones are not part of package. Overall I am happy with my purchase.

  The M31 specs I bought was 8GB RAM, 128 GB Storage. The design and hold on mobile is excellent. Ocean Blue Colour and finish is very impressive, though I wanted a black.

  Well the very first like is for fast charging and massive battery of Samsung Galaxy M31. Next thing is its inbuilt 128 GB of storage capacity and it can be increased to SD card of size 512 GB. When we use this smartphone it really feels like we have a device with all the features that we get on a Laptop/Desktop. The camera quality is also best as every snapped photo has pinpoint details. The slow motion feature is the one that I liked the most and we can even edit the recorded videos on this device itself. The last but not the least is its sound quality of speaker and headphones mode is really remarkable plus outstanding. All in all this is a must have device for the youth as well as every person who wished to do a lot of things using smartphone.When I purchased this device, the very same moment I also made one of my friends to buy it at that same time.

  Way too amazing budget phone Samsung has ever launched.The premium quality experience you enjoy on display is beyond expectation in this range.The finger print is also pretty good along with facial recognition feature which will suffice at this price.Slim design is unbelievable considering the fact that it's packed with 6000mah battery and on that note, one must not forget how efficiently Samsung has managed to balance and maintain its weight.Gaming experience is really treat to your eyes as well as your soul, not just saying but actually tried playing Call of Duty(mobile), Asphalt 9 Legends and FIFA, once again what graphic quality at this level of price range.Camera quality is something you cannot avoid talking in Samsung phone, which in this case also, it beats all the budget phones camera in its segment.I will just speak for myself, I am really happy with the phone introduced by Samsung, rest it might vary from person to person🙂

A Mega Monster that got everything big , but with limitations..
",5,"

  Display: FHD+ is Super Amazing, the latest M31s with punch hole instead of the notch would be a better experience.Finger Print: Mostly works, but at times don't react at all as if you haven't touched it and will have to try again after pressing the lock button.Camera: Lot of options if interested in Photography and making Videos.Would have to explore with all the modes to get an idea of its capabilities especially if you were using a single camera phone earlier. Videos aren't so great in low lights and Indoor photos depends on the lighting condition but fair enough.Macro is a bit disappointing. Overall good. Hope they give all the software update for the great features of the latest M31s.Battery:  1 day is for sure, can get up to 2 days on a minimal to average usage. But sadly 15 W charger, you will have to keep it aside for along time once it drains off Or else you will have to remember to charge it during the times you are sure that you won't be using the phone. Hope this had the 25W fast charger like in the latest M31s.Overall a good phone,  got everything for a normal user.

  Been using this phone (Space Black, 8GB/128GB) variant since 30th of June. Absolute bang for your buck. Even though the processor isn't Best-In-Class, it delivers smooth performance. Haven't experienced any lag, stutter or excessive heating up. This phone has got the basics right. Out of words for the battery life. Camera is also good, but not the best. Facial recognition is decent.Pros:Crisp display, 6000mAh battery, superfast fingerprint unlock, smooth performance, great speakers, overall high Value-For-Money product.Cons:Poor low-light camera performance, night mode is terrible, poor video stabilization, facial recognition is a little slow if not held from a fixed angle, plastic back is a fingerprint magnet, hence atleast a random back case should have been provided.Rating: 9.2/10Highly recommended!!

Or not getting the calls over whats-app.She has used Android phones for a long time already.So i think most could be software problems, so i installed appropriate once for her to make it work better. I am still looking up on the internet if the phone has some persistent hardware or software issues, like with the wifi card because of which intermittent connectivity problems could occur.The phone works fairly fine when i am using it.

  Fingerprint reader: Fast indeed, got some scratches after 6months but that doesn't decrease the sensitivity.Battery life: Okay, this will vary depending on uses. I keep the mobile data and hotspot on almost 24x7. Moreover I listen to podcast, music or watch movies on streaming platforms for very long time. After 6 months still I'm getting almost 1day of battery life.Camera quality: I'd not say best but it's good. You can capture decent pictures depending on the lighting condition. Daylight performance is really good. Low light performance is satisfactory, but not on the high end. Night mode is okayish. The 64MP sensor is good for capturing images with good amount of details in it.OS: Not suitable for rigorous Gaming uses.

Great product at a budget

  A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.Pros-----* Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.* Video stabilization is up to the mark* Amoled screens are always glamorizing* AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern)* Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.* Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.* Single speaker but loud enough for basic usageCons------* Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.* Night mode could be optimized.Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.#MadeInIndia

Overall value for money phone

  Overall phone is good. My computer screen photo comes little bad but other photos are awesome.The problem which i found is that if this phone is charged in warmer environment(30-40 °C) then its charging speed is slow and phone gets little warm eg it take me 2.75 hrs for charging my phone from 25 to 100%. And if it is not hot outside then it will take 2 hrs for the same. Other features like camera, fingerprint sensor, and screen quality are best in class. The face unlock is little slow in first time when used after more screen lock time. But phone is best and it's value for money phone.Phone does not get warm after use of more than 4 hrs continuously.Tip- keep its back clean otherwise dust particles attaches on it and that looks little bad.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a  massive 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The camera is one of the best update Samsung made in M series. It gives premium quality images. The display is also good but can be made better if provided with Gorilla Glass 5 on both sides of the phone. The phone worked pretty smooth and fast while switching apps. The fingerprint sensor located on the back also works quickly in unlocking the device.Somehow satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy M31, but MI mobiles are much better than Samsung Galaxy M31 in this price range.I have bought this phone only because of boycotting the Chinese Mobile Phones, otherwise I have gone for Redmi Note 9 Pro.

  I was initially interested in buying the A70 or A80, but after reading reviews online, I decided to go for the M31-- And a great choice it was as the M31 is a fantastic phone at this price-point!The advanced display beats the competition hands-down, with images being far superior to the standard Oled; the number of cameras, especially the 64MP one performs flawlessly, though not as well in low light conditions, but the images are good enough to pass the test easily!In my humble opinion, the M31 is a steal and a deal!As I'm not a professional in this field, please do also go through the opinions of, ""Pofessional Reviewers"" online before making a final decision and-- All the Very Best with Whatever your Choice may be!

Super AMOLED Display and touch sensitivity

  Thanks to Amazon for early delivery of my Samsung M31. I am writing this after two weeks of use. What I like is the super AMOLED Disply and feather touch sensitivity (I have not used any screen guard) and good battery back up. I am not a gamer, hence don't know about gaming performance. I got one and half days battery back up which is good. Overall photo quality is very good. I have switched all my apps and datas from my old phone to my new samsung M31 by using Samsung Switch app which works nicely. The phone is having dedicated sim and memmory card slots. The fast charging works smoothly. No heating issue for normal use. Sound quality is also decent. Even though it is made of plastic it looks very good in appearance.Some of the demerits are it is not having nofication light however the way in which the AMOLED display the notification is superior to having notification light.  The weight is litle bit more. No dedicated Music app is pre installed.When I opened the phones box I found lots of dust inside the box and it looks like non professional packing.

  I am sharing my experiences here after using around 2 months. I never write reviews but feeling happy so writing reviews.What I liked in this phone.1) look is awesome. Now Samsung has improved many things in looks.2) it has good battery backup for me it gives around 48 hours backup. In my phone have many applications where I need notification on every update, around spend 3 or 4 hours spending on YouTube & udmey videos. 2 or 3 hours calling and other many things like net surfing etc. so I am satisfied with the backup.3.) Pictures quality is much better than Chinese phones even didn't expected this type of camera quality from Samsung's.4) never heating since bought.5) face lock and figure sensor is working fast.So this phone has many good reasons to buy, there is nothing to dislike.

Great mid range phone
",5,"

  Wow! Finally a budget phone in the mid range packed with features that you generally expect in the realmes or redmis. After using it for good 10 days here's my review:BATTERY LIFE- The battery on this one is the star. This 6000mAh powerhouse does deliver.  Even after 3 hrs of video calling, power consumption is just 20%. Intense gaming, use of camera, e mails,online video playback and lots more, it can handle anything you throw at it. Charging is slow but you have to consider that 6000mAh battery would take some time to charge up. You charge it once  and wouldn't need to do it again for the entire day.2. DISPLAY: In this area also the AMOLED display  will win you over, with the drop notch design is very pleasing to the eyes, colour and contrast are also great.3. CAMERA: The pictures are amazing in bright light,  the wide angle lens also works fine,  however macro or low light pictures may not be up to the mark.  64 MP sensor is not default and have to be changed in the camera settings. But the picture do have great depth, colour, contrast and resolution. The 64 mp camera performs better than other mobile phones in terms of clarity and true colour.OS: Android 10 with Samsung skins.Overall: great product worth purchasing.

Best phone in this price range!

  Reviewing after 5 months usage. Still working just as it used to the day it was purchased on. Bought the 6 GB 64 GB variant and totally satisfied. Unlike most of the other phones, it stays true to the 6000mah battery as listed, offering battery backup upto 3 days when watching offline videos.For requirements demanding games like PUBG mobile it offers very high (60) fps on smooth to balanced graphics settings and medium (40-45) fps on higher graphics settings with minimal heating. Runs PUBG mobile continuously for 5 hours with considerably minimal heating whilst leaving behind satisfactory battery for further use thanks to Exynos 9611 processor which offers clock speed of 2.3 + 1.7 GHz.Offers excellent quality for both front and rear cameras with precise accuracy and original colors. Very impressed by the camera quality both front and rear. Face unlock works just great unlocking the screen within one second. Equipped with swift fingerprint sensor which responds in less than a second. The best phone ever experienced upto this price range. Completerly satisfied. Worth every penny!

M31 Best value for money
",4,"

  M31 the best at this price. Best value for money.  I was using galaxy note 8. And unfortunately i had to cut down my budget  temporarily.  So i picked this one just for the time being.  Honestly saying i never compromise in quality thats why i always bought too model phones.  But this time i am very happy because i did not have to compromise in quality even though i picked this cheaper one.  I am not going to through this for bagging the top model.  I am satisfied by its performance.  I bought this on 25th of May.  And its perfectly working so far.  I recommend M31 rather than other chinese fancy phones with less price n more futures.  There is no comparison for samsung quality.  I use samsung' phones since last 9 years. And like always Amazon is the best in services n deliveries.  That is why i am registered with amazon for so many years

  Samsung Galaxy M31What to Expect?As Said By Samsung itself That It Is a Monster Of a Phone Since It Has Quite a Bit Upgrade when It Comes to Battery And Camera Which is Absolutely  True According to my Usage After 1 WeekPros:-•Super Amoled Display Which is The best In Market Also better Than most Of The 120Hz Displays I have Used•6000MaH battery With Gaming And Heavy Usage It Easily Lasts for 1 and 1/2 Days. Even More If I Resort To Lighter Usage Close to 2 Days Then.•Charger Provided Inside Is a Fast charger That Typically Charges The Monster Battery To 100% in 2 And 1/2 Hours•Samsung One UI 2.0 Is Very User Friendly And fast While Operating So There Is No Issue with That•Quad Camera is by Far The best in this Range I Have Used Other Phones In 20k Range But None can Beat These camera Sensors. Portraits are perfect,Macro Camera is Okayish but Overall In this price Range It is the best•Exynos Processor used In This one is Pretty Fast and Handles multiple Processing Task fluently•Single handed mode is enabled And Also Full screen mode is Enabled• Audio output out of this one is Good But Not The best In this Price RangeCons:-•Device Sometimes Tend To Heat Up a Little While gaming Coz This Is Not a Gaming Phone Ofcourse But The Ram Management And the Game Booster Given By samsung Manages It WellConclusion:-Overall In this price Range Samsung Has Provided Us with a Beast Phone Irrespective of A little low Gaming Performance but Other than That You dhpuld Totally Go For this Phone If u Want to Watch movies And entertainment  on Netflix, Prime and also Want a good user Experience,  Battery Life and CameraRating:- 4 out Of 5

""M31-THE LEGEND""

   Samsung Galaxy M31 6GBRam 128GB internal storage is an excellent mobile with many extraordinary features like,1. Good sound quality2. Good screen sensibilty3. Fast processing4. Good picture quality5. Good screen ratio6. Good comparable dimensions7. High battery life8. Fast charging9. Good quality in built apps10. Clear voice while talking11. Self adjusting ability12. Excellent voice recorderAnd so on......It is especially good for online classes which which consumes less battery and it doesn't require much charging.  It has a high storage and its processing system doesn't gets slow down by adding more apps even.  One bad feature is it gets hanged sometimes and it needs to get refreshed 2-3 times so that it comes to its proper track again, apart from this everything's excellent  Due to fair cost and its salient features M31 is attracting more and more costumers in the market and I too recommend to buy M31 if you are looking for a good phone

Go Blind, No Regret Even 1%

  Firstly , I am not writing a review. This what exactly I felt, I have shared below.1st, I got a such a phone which actually last 02days battery with decent use. Trust me none of the phone has this capability till now.2nd, Low light camera is awesome.  I took a picture at 19:30hrs at minimum street light which actually look like I took the picture at 16:30hrs in sunlight.3rd, Others camera feature is awesome , which I am not saying, my picture saying that.4. Front camera is also good, clear.5. Screen flash is enough to give you decent quality pic at zero light.Frankly speaking I did a lot of experiments in a dark room.6. It never heat up when charging. One or 02 days it heated up when I was charging at middle of the day and outside temperature was 42°c. Otherwise in the morning time it charge quick and fast.7. My friends told me dont buy samsung as samsung phone hang a lot. I have use 2 samsung phone earlier, so I know they are right but still I bought this phone for camera as 64mp samsung camera, so I ignore that. After using a month I gave my phone and said use as much as application,  if it will hang I will give this phone free. They use 15 applications at a time and playing pubg in this phone. They did not found any lags even.8. The ram availability is less 3.4 to 3.6 while not using. While using still you will have 1.4 gb available after using 12 applications were opened.9. Fingerprint reader work fast , accurate better than my last phone J7 max.10. Look wise it gives the feeling of Samsung S20 phone, lite weight . Better than any phone.Dear all, go blind for this , you will not regret 1% even.

  Nice phone.. it has good and stable UI. Using this phone from last one month no issues as such. Battery lasts for a day, with frequent use of maps, multimedia, office mails and chat. Recommend to use phone back cover as it is too soft and scratched. Camera works perfectly fine in dim light. Fingerprint sensor is very responsive and even unlocking of phone with front camera works fine. Some gesture controls (screen shot and single hand use) could be improved. Works fine with Airtel and considerably good WiFi calling function. Let's see how long it lasts with my rough usage.

User review for Galaxy M31
",5,"

  As far as the hardware is considered they are no issues but when it comes to software, there's a lot to be improved. The current UI isn't compactable with the phone and because of that, there are flickering issues while using google but other than this there aren't any major issues.Since it is a mid-range budget phone it isn't ideally meant for gaming. If any high-end graphics games are considered like COD or pubg, the phone heats up real fast thereby reducing the battery life.There haven't been any issues with the touch like I said earlier. The features provided for this price are really good.Coming to the camera, I'd give 4.5/5 ratings. I've uploaded sample photos taken on this phone. All the features provided are extremely good but in professional mode, there isn't an option to control the shutter speed(only con). Also, the camera needs a lot of light to capture every minute detail if shooting in low light the images are all husky.Overall I'd recommend, if you are looking for an exclusive good camera-based and daily usage, it's the best option.

A real monster as it is..

  I am comparing my galaxy M31 to a monster truck..Starting with exterior it have a huge build quality and the display is great compared to any other trucks in market. About the safety features, fingerprint sensor and face unlock is there to open this truck with a decent performance, rear camera with 64mp is great(macro wide etc👌)and also the front camera 32mp give clear pictures and videos.Coming to engine side it works in any terrain without any delay and moreover no heating issues from engine side. Another top feature is the fuel capacity(6000mah battery) that it give a huge backup for long running. Overall it is the mega monster truck that going to defeat all other trucks in the market.

Awsome M31

  This is an awsome phone in this price range. This phone has a camera which does most of the work for you. You just need a vision, and you will get fabulous pictures. The wide angle camera is very helpful as it lets you capture extra. The fingerprint scanner is very smooth and it never lags. The front camera is so nice that it makes almost every kind of face photogenic. You can just forget about everything else and click awsome selfies anytime, anywhere. No need to worry about your best angle. Click picture from any angle and the image processing software will do the rest and make you look like a Greek God. Once you've charged it 100% and Even if you keep your mobile data ON continuously, you won't need to charge it even after 48 hours or continuous internet usage.The battery life is so good that I keep my mobile data ON all the time and I take at least 5 online classes on Google meet a day and I need to charge it after 36 hours.This phone is hell of a work mule and this phone can take on everything thrown to it.Hats off to Samsung for making this...

Unmatched Value at this Price!

  The reason I went for the M31 was because most reviews I adjudged it as ""bang for the buck"", and because Samsung is a trusted brand. I was familiar with the M series as my mother owns an M30s and after a week of using this phone, I am glad I made the decision to buy it.Firstly, the most amazing thing about the M31 is the battery life. The battery comfortably lasts for more than 30 hours with moderately heavy use. The 15W charger keeps charging times fairly low. The M31 comes with Android 10 pre-loaded and the dark mode is something I really love! The performance is smooth, the UI is neat and clean, and the display looks crisp with good vibrancy. I really like the camera's performance in daylight and the quality of the images is quite sharp. However, I felt that low light photos are quite decent and could be better. The phone feels slightly heavier than the M30s because of the bigger battery but the difference is not very noticeable. I bought the Space Black version and while it looks classy, it does pick up fingerprints easily. I would recommend getting a case for that reason, even though the phone is quite comfortable to grip. Ergonomically, the buttons are well-placed and the fingerprint sensor works really well. I feel that on the whole, the phone is perfect for anyone looking for a durable device that can cover all the bases within the 15-20K range!PROS- Battery Life- Daylight Camera- Display- Android 10 UICONS- Night Shots- Spammy notifications (can be easily disabled)

Cool Monster ❤

  I am amazed with cool features Samsung providing with M31, hereby listing out which I can1. Battery life is totally monstrous as Samsung displayed2. Some of us are used to have habit of clicking here it is providing Camera with beautiful  contrast, Rear and Front both are master in their category with some latest features.3. Display, the best I have ever used. SUPER AMOLED and smooth and shiny comes with Gorilla glass  which is also provided in camera glass cover  which can melt anyone's  heart.4. Ram and Processor are legends in this category, Anyone can choose different variants as per his/her usage, I am using 6/128 and feels getting faster and smoother 😎5. Nice Gameplay,6. Provides latest updates and compatible features7. Music and audio with Dolby Atmos as always which is the best thing about Samsung phonesThis is the high time when anyone wants to have non-chinese smartphone and equally competting or I would say more than fake Chinese phones with no longer life than 2 years. And many more things I loving this experiencing

  Battery life is better than others but still it cannot stand for two days with regular internet usage.Camera is quality is great.  But using wide angle view stretches the image and distorts the faces as well .Big space makes life easier.Fingerprint sensor could be more sensitive.Just missed a wow review due to little things but Overall this mobile justifies its cost.

Slow motion video works well.7. No any lagging issues.8. Face unlock and finger print sensor works fine, but I am not using  face unlock feature.9. Charging is very fast.Cons:1. No charging, notification  LED. Flash can be used as notification2. Battery claims as 6000 mAh, for normal use it is ok. As soon as start watching videos,  internet surfing battery starts draining fast. For normal  use it my stand for 2 days.Overall very good mobile in this price range.

Immense battery life, quad camera setup and great display!
",4,"

  I've got the 6GB+128GB variant and thanks to early access and Prime Delivery experience....Pro:1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel -  best display in the price range.3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.7. Price.Cons:1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile. Also use a case and tempered glass for drop protection🙂.

  Phone is good at these price range with FHD Super amoled screen as we can is good. Yet you can opt for A series over thisTalking at the pros :1. FHD super amoled screen is beautiful. when you buy it just set your display setting at natural.2. 6000 Mah Huge battery normal usgage will last 2 days.3. Opearting system One UI 2.0 is good.4. Gaming on this phone is Ok.5 .  64 MP camera is Ok.Cons :1. Big charging time 2-2.30 Hrs as we a huge battery. 15W fast charging at this price is not sufficient atleast 20W is appreciated.2. OK camera performance.As a Opinion if you want to you a back cover with your phone you can go with this phone or else A' Series phones has greater design than M series phones for that they price a little more.and One serious compliant want to add, i haven't received a sim ejector pin inside the box. as Samsung brand these things should not be expected.  This is a minute thing but as i buy a Samsung i wont except such things .

  TRENDINGBEST MOBILESUPCOMING PHONESTOP NEWSHome » Mobile » ReviewsSamsung Galaxy M31: The Good, The Bad, And The X FactorBy Sandeep SarkarUpdated: Friday, March 20, 2020, 16:56 [IST]Samsung has added a new handset in the Galaxy M series dubbed Galaxy M31. The company introduced this series last year to compete against its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi and Realme who own a major chunk of the market with feature-rich smartphones being offered an affordable price tag.The latest entrant comes as a successor to the Galaxy M30s which has been quite popular in the mid-range segment. Carrying some traits from its predecessor, the Galaxy M31 is packed with a humongous 6,000 mAh battery and an L-shaped quad-camera module.At a starting price label of Rs. 14,999 for the 6GB RAM+64GB storage and Rs. 15,999 for the 6GB RAM+128GB storage model, it goes up against the likes of the Honor 9X, Redmi Note 8 Pro, and the Realme XT. Let's see what this device brings to the table and how good is it against the Chinese rivals in our initial impressions:Samsung Galaxy M31: The GoodHigh-Resolution Super AMOLED DisplayThe first thing that will grab your attention while buying this handset is its big high-resolution display. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with a 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display that churns out 1080 x 2340 pixels FHD+ resolution and has a tall 19:5:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has never compromised with the display quality; which seems evident on the Galaxy M31 as well.The tall display complemented by high-resolution support makes it suitable for 1080p videos. Moreover, the narrow bezels all around the display give you the maximum area to watch content. The U-shaped notch is slightly bigger.The colors delivered are punchy and vivid, something which you will find on other mid-range Samsung smartphones as well. The viewing angles and sunlight visibility seems good. But, we will be able to give feedback after a thorough usage. It is worth noting that this is the same display that the company had used on its predecessor, i.e, the Galaxy M30s. So, you can expect the same display output.

  Battery- this phone have good battery backup but it doesnt deel like 6000 mah battery.so,i give 4 star for battery.Display- very good display i like very much.Camera- i want to give 3 but i give 4 i dont know why. I give low rating to camera because every photos you take  it never feels like 64 mp it look like a just little bit good then regular camera and selfie is worse it look like beauty plus.Gaming - this phone have nice processor you can play games in high graphics smoothly but not extremely but its okay for me becaude this phone is not gaming phone.Fingerprint reader-i dont want to say much about this beacuse its okay not that fast as well as not slow.If you want to take non chinese product and  regular base phone with all the things in under 17000 believe  me this phone is the best.

IT'S WORTH BUYING SMARTPHONE IN MID RANGE
",4,"

  Samsung is constantly improving its level..on mid range phone..If i talk about its...looks i think you may have to compromise a bit....but wait a min..there's a lot imp things rather than looks...1.Camera✌ 💖----- Awesome camera quality, some says that there is no zoom feature in 64mp mode..yes it is right...but honestly speaking you dont require one, as the pic is so clear that...it really gives a stunning details.2. Battery✌💖--awesome battery power of 6000mh...if you are a heavy user I am dam sure this is gonna be a very plus point...One imp thing also...when I was buying this phone I got to know that it dosen't come with fast charging...and you have to wait 4 to 5hrs ...I was bit worried about that...but when I first charged my phone I was shocked to know that you can completely charge your phone in 60mins.3.Fingerprint✌💔---As usual you expect from Samsung it's awesome but...there is no..in display fingerprint sensor.4.Display💖💖---Its super awesome as its SuperAmoled5😔😔😔.The thing  from which I am disappointed is only that it doesn't come with..Samsung Knox.😔...but I think if you dont use this..then this phone is worth buying...but if you use this feature then shift to A-series...6..😉😉A most imp thing is I am a Samsung user from last 6years I can assure you Samsung gives...more than what is shown in display...as many small features which we use in daily are generally not covered in Advertisements.

  Worth a buy. This is my honest review here.I spent a week in deciding to purchase a phone under 20K. With the likes of Redmi note pro max and poc x2 and other competitors,  I was not able to choose the better one. But anyways I went ahead with M31. And no regrets.Delivery: 10/10Packaging: 10/10Overall: 9/10Camera: 8/10Sound: 7/10UI: 10/10Exynoss Processor: 9/10Fingerprint scanner: 10/10I'm not a gamer. So this phone is best for day to day use. I cannot comment on other phones though. And also you would decide not to purchase this phone if you see the negative reviews it's got. But I would say it's worth a buy.Review after one month :Same performance, good battery backup. No heating issues.But , I just compared M31 with Poco X3, and without a doubt x3 is way better than m31 except for Amoled Screen.

It's a winner!!
",4,"

  This mobile is one of the best in its price range. Firstly, the battery is rock solid. At 6000 mah, it comes for more than one and a half day's usage for a hard user like me. The display is kickass and the other features like finger print sensor and face recognition works fast too. On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.The quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.This is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version. But with the amount of photos and videos you are gonna shoot with this superb camera, I am sure you would want to have more memory.

Samsung Galaxy M31 is a royalty to have in hand
",1,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31 is a royalty to have in hand. The sleek handset with its broad 6.4-inch display is remarkable. Android version 10.0 with an octa-core processor, allows smooth working of the smartphone. Its interface is very user friendly. With its unique features like 4 screen split, M31 is a handy device for people of all tiers and arenas. The long lasting battery life is the most important feature for people with busy and hectic schedules. Lastly, the most commendable camera setup of 64MP+8MP with an Ultra wide lens and 32MP front facing camera is the highlight of the handset. The clarity and depth of the lens is amazing and for people who love photography its an equivalent to a professional camera. Its a treat for technology lovers and a boon for all. An Indian product which should reach all households.

Good battery life: Once fully charged I am using this phone for two days in normal conditions. Even if extensive gaming, battery longs for a full day2.

I use mobile phone for watching movie even if my laptop has big screen only for its amoled screen expereince.4. I have been using it for around a month now and it never struck or were never lagging.5. I have played high graphic games like pubg. It supports wellHowever there is small con I noticced1.

  So first of all i want to clear few thing about this phone which many of them might think that it's a problem1.first the macro camera would not be accurate which is common for quad camera phones,  first i also thought it's a  defect but after seeing the phone in some youtube videos i realized it is not a defect2. Second is when i switched on my phone it gone to the boot page and i was shocked but it isn't a problem  at all so don't worry3.the third thing is, your phone will discharge a bit faster for the first four days and it's  normal and you don't need to think about any return or replacement of your phoneSo, finally the review>The phone's camera is very good>The phone gives screen on time of around 10.5hours>this phone's display is marvellous,  right from viewing angles to brightness and clarity of the phone>the performance is very good in normal usage and about gaming i don't know because i don't play gamesThank you for reading my review

  I ordered this Samsung galaxy m31 and I am very much satisfied with this phone,the battery is extremely good , the display is excellent,The back body is somehow fingerprinted prone but in this price point is it fine to have so.The camera could have been better with a quad-camera setup, other it works fine for a normal user, but for a person who loves to click pictures and have a decent knowledge of photography will find it less efficient.Overall the phone works very well, it does not lags, do not heats up, charge time is also good with a 15-watt charger.Its a good buy for the amount of money we are spent fort this.

Average product comparing with M21 features and price
",5,"

  The phone has the same VOLTE network problem. It's not stable, especially when using mobile data. Cant receive required signal strength for 4G.The camera is no doubt good.The battery is good but not so-called ""Monster"", what is generally expected in a 6000mha battery. As the device has a large display (HD)  and high camera features it automatically consumes more power than other devices.Charging takes a huge time (more than 3hrs).Unecsesay 2.5k price higher than M21 without processor up-gradation just having high MP cameras.

  I'd like to take up this opportunity to thank Samsung for launching this phone since this was the need of the hour, while I was struggling with my old Mi phone which had alot of hardware defects, I came across this phone on Amazon & thought for giving it a try. Coming to the point, I'm very much satisfied with this product but I'd like to list 2 problems which I've been facing, the 1st being the charging problem as it takes hell lot of time to get charged, on an approx 3 hours to get full charged but I see they've improved this experience in their latest model M31s. Secondly, I feel the network reception is not as expected. I've been working from home ever since the pandemic started using hotspot & I do feel it's capacity to stay consistent in terms of network is just satisfactory. While I'll be attending meetings sometimes it will be a problem as I'll face network breakage, I insist Samsung to take this point into consideration & improve in the next releases. Thankyou.

Amazing phone with great battery life.

  I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks now and I must say that I am very much impressed. The camera quality is just amazing. Even in low lights, the picture quality is amazing. The screen is always been a usp of Samsung phones and this phone screen lives upto the expectations. Battery life is simply amazing. For me it goes thru the second day with almost 4 to 5 hours of gaming, 2 to 3 hours of internet surfing and calls as well. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good as well. I have not experienced any lag while using the phone and switching between different apps is smooth. Overall a nice phone in such great price.

Excellent smartphone in this price range from a well known brand
",4,"

  I have been using Samsung Galaxy M31 for the last 3 weeks. This is the best smartphone in this arenna of specifications and price. The camara quality is excellent especially selfie cam. Primary camera is good but not as much as expected from a 64 mp cam but picture quality is good. Live focus could be improved a little more.Fingerprint sensor works well.Battery life is more or less good and has good back up but feel that the battery is getting drained a little more faster when using with bluetooth headset. I usually charge the battery every morning with an average from 35 % based on the previous days usage.Couldnt feel much difference with 4 gb ram and 6 gb ram versions while using applications but am not font of gaming.Overall the phone works smoothly and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to buy a smartphone with this budget.

Voice issue
",5,"

  1.The voice is not so clear. It is actually cutting our voice when we are in noise area. Along with outside noise our voice is also cutting. This is the one drawback.2.When 64mp camera option is selected not possible to zoom the capture area and also not able to on the flash light.Otherwise the piece is good

Lockdown Samsung M31 happy customer review
",4,"

  Most recommended over other phones.Samsung M31 is an amazing phone with best features. It has 64 mega pixels camera(4 camera lenses) and fingerprint scanner at the back.Its has best sound quality and clarity of its back and front camera is extraordinarily amazing.This product has 64 gb internal storage which makes it better to store data.It has various inbuilt apps which are necessary for day to day life.The phone is a all rounder and it has strong and long battery life.If you buy this phone during lockdown, you won't wait for lockdown to end rather you will pray for lockdown to increase 🙂Also, the wide screen enables you to view smaller objects better. It also has wide length screen shot as feature.All of these features are available in brand like samsumg and at very reasonable price.If you have high speed internet and if you are into business or if you are service provider and you want to use this phone for your work then it is very useful.Please note these are my personal views based on my experience with this phone.Also, you may gift this to your loved ones in order to experience the joy they feel after getting best technology.

Very good Mobile in this budget

  I loved this phone, I am using since 1 week. Battery life is awesome, for games its awesome. Camera quality is more than enough for me as I am not a professional photographer. I just wanted a non Chinese phone as well with all features it solves all the problem. If any one want to buy don't think for second time go for it.Only issue i found the charger wire length is bit small. apart from that it has all cool features  specially Samsung switch it will reduce your effort to ZERO for transfer your data from old phone to new phone. it transfer everything.

Great mobile!  Totally worth it!

  I have been using this mobile for 5 days now and writing the review today. It's a very nice mobile with great camera quality. It's battery life is terrific! But I suggested you to make sure its above 85% charged for better battery life. The fingerprint reader is good as well. The storage is already filled by 20GB ( due to inbuilt apps, some of which you can uninstall)  U can see the pics taken by this phone camera ( a random pic of candle). It's really amazing. If you are planning to buy a phone with great battery, camera and Storage, this is the perfect choice.

Must go for Samsung Galaxy M31... Awesome Phone
",5,"

  Samsung M31 is very good mobile. If anybody is comparing old Samsung mobiles last 5 to 7 years back. Don't compare with current Samsung Galaxy mobiles. I am using last one week and writing a review. Before Samsung I used Vivo but in recent years Samsung  is the best. Quality is quality.Pros..1. Mobile is very classic.2. Camera is awesome3. Battery life is too good than any other mobile.4. Charging is very fast. 15 W charger5. Touch pad finger sensor very very classic.6. Slick mobile and overall the best in the range of 16k.7. In covid19 situation Amazons delivery is very safe and careful. So thanks Amazon.Cons....1. Samsung should provide mobile cover.Suggestion:If anybody is thinking purchase of mobile in the range of 15k to 20k must go for Samsung.

  It is a wonderful product from samsung in this price range.as we all know the other options available which are realme , xiaomi, redmi out of them i was fascinated by samsung because of the spectacular super amoled display packaged  with infinity u display minimum bazels and 6000 mah huge monster battery which will hold your back 1 to 1.5 days with heavy usage.Last by not the least the samsung processor will give you lag free experience for dialy usage amd for intense gaming it will be working fine in medium settings without any  frame drops.The quad Camera setup  in also very good in this phone which is also good in day light as well as artificial lightning conditions and gives us power to record the front as well back video with 4k resolution and front camera in this 32 mp camera which is good and the is supported by typical samung software to enhance the colours and skin tones which makes the every click look good.The only feature i wish it had is in-display fingerprint scanner.I think in this price range it is one of the best phones which i can say tue value for money product.

Awesome battery life!
",5,"

  coming from a Samsung S7 Edge, I always wanted a phone with an awesome screen and a good battery life. This phone has them both. Its a bit heavier than the S7 Edge, but it is because of the 6000mah battery. My usage is average and I have never experienced and issue with his one. first charging I felt that the phone was heating but that has stopped after the first software upgrade. Awesome phone for a budget.

Poor speaker
",5,"

  I feel the speaker is very poor compared to Redmi Note 7. Same song with full volume on Redmi Note 7 seems 50% more. Lags some important feature like remote sensor. Feels very delicate in hand, if your are rough handler pls get a case.Device had old image at least 3 months, I had to install new updates which was around 600MB, even the April 1 security patch was not present even i purchased late in May. Even apps like Facebook, MS Office, Amazon etc were old and had to spend time in installing newer version before use. Also Comes with lot of Samsung apps which seems too much for a new phone, had to uninstall many of them, themes, wallpapers were all outdatedAndroid One UI has totally messed up the system setting/properties, its very difficult to find even the basic like default launcher (I love Microsoft Launcher so wanted to set it as home launcher).I didn't feel battery is monster, its getting drained for me in a day with hot spot continuously on for more than 10 hrs. Also the charging cable is short, little bit more than 2 feet. The fast charging is also questionable  as it takes more than 3 hrs to fully charge.

  Amazing phone, smooth, feels more like i phone 11. Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used foreverOkay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recentlyI guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like  a brand new one.My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth againThe phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone..I suggest all the customers to buy a m31

  This product reminds me what I have invested in gold or property yes sounds weird but it's true as it's performance is becoming great day by day with the timely security updates and bug fixes (bugs totally invisible) Lol ,, yes great device samsung launched in descent price which is welcomed by many indian consumers , and main focus was in battery as it can demolish the big monster as battery having lots of energy , finger print scanner and display all are good , inbuilt apps are super fined with timely updates but, yes a product is made up of good and bad quality and we can't say bad but the 1 star I have deducted is for camera it is great but not that great as I was looking for but it worked fine for me at the end of the day so this is my review of this product after 4 month of use.

Somewhat Happy

  It's been a week or so I got the phone from Amazon, haven't tried everything..but here's what I did..Battery life is good.. I work in 8-10 hours shift and pretty much dependent on my mobile but never had to use my power bank even for once.. BUT, when I play big size and graphics game(Pes etc) it drains pretty fast.. So that's a bad or worse I haven't figured it out yet..Processor is pretty good I haven't had much lagging problem since games are smooth.. I worried a lot before stepping over Exynos but I guess this one is par with SD 710 maybe a little less but haven't had a big problem..Camera is OK..Could have been much better..I didn't find particular app lock on this phone yet.. I saw on the review it's on the A31 but not on this one so that's a bad thing on an upgrade..Despite 15w charger it's somewhat fast on charging..I'll update my review after a month so till now that's all I got..

  ●It is an amazing phone which provides all-round performance whether we talk of battery(which is the biggest current battery available the 6000Mah)●Its camera is also incredible as compared to other smartphones in this range. As well as above mid-range smartphones also doesn't have such camera (64+8+5+5). It also has AR Doodle and AR Emojis.●Next is its performance which is obviously one very nice. While playing PUBG one can easily enjoy the game on high graphics for long without major overheating issues.●Samsung is known for its security and it has provided:->Inbuilt McAfee antivirus protection,>Inbuilt VPN>Inbuilt WiFi protection.Also the OS and UI are amazing and very handy.It also has amazing split screen view which can even run in camera. And using pop-up view we can even open 5 APPLICATIONS at a time and even more.Users may not be able to find all these features in first time but will obviously able to find them by viewing some tutorial video of this beast smartphone.By using this smartphone one can surely say that this is a #MegaMonster

King samsung M31
",4,"

  I bought this phone because of the brand name ""samsung"". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.  This phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life. Camera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality  is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming.  Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..Fingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.Ram is also fabulous.  No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.  From my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends  pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can't use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.  Still I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........

Honest Review.

  Samsung M31, a nice and decent mobile.Front Camera - Amazing.Rear Camera - Fantastic. (Those who are giving bad reviews about both cameras, they dont know how to use a mobile camera. Dont listen to those one star reviews)Battery - Monster. (My phone screen remains on during my office time and I am an heavy user. And in the end of the day, it still left with 45- 50% battery) So if battery is your concern, go for it. It won't disappoint you.Yes it's multitasking is really good but if you want this for gaming purpose, my friends, you will be disappointed. As i was using Redmi Note 6 Pro before this and I play Mortal Kombat all day. It was not lagging on that phone but on this phone its kind of lagging. Clash Royal - Yes it's  lagging.Real Racing 3 -Yes its lagging.But at this price range a good processor would be appreciated.Overall, its a good phone with average processor but with good cameras.

  Best all-rounder Mobile with in the price range. Used for 10days. So far no issues found. Amazing display quality than expected. Monster Battery is good losting about 1.5 day. Camera quality is good not the best. Only major drawback is it is taking more time to charge almost 2.5hours to 3 hours. Company claimed quick charge actually it's not quick. Instead of 2A if they provide 4A charger it will be good. Anyway good product and great value for money.

And the battery last for over 36 hours.Display: I'm in love. The vibrant colours have made my experience really amazing.No lags  and no Bugs experienced so far.And a plus plus is the power saving mode. 11% battery gives 10hrs plus.

  Just it looks great as aspected from samsung and Its sAmoled Display Is ming goggling.And lets talk about its fingerprint reader ,it is exceptionally great.(could be more better)Then second,Battery life , in my perspective it is great but charging is a bit slow.Now third its Camera wuality in broad daylight its great and outstanding but in night mode it has a bad looks ,the whole structure of this seems to be dull in night mode.(should have to learn with Google Pixel)UI is also Great but themes and wallpaper and fonts are not so great and keyboard also has not good looks.Exynos 9611soc processor is a little bit catchy ,not getting very  good result.(It generally heats).But in midrange It is overall A great phone.😇😇😇😇.Haptics are also great .But i would say samsung should try backglass with gorilla glass t and more design varient .Not at all satisfied with back design likewise.

Typical samsung scam.
",5,"

  Although the phone has 6000 mAh battery. It is only slightly better than other 5000 mAh phones as the equinox processor in M31 sucks. It is almost 2 generations behind the latest snapdragon processor. As equinox is also owned by samsung, it is a scam to promote their products. This is the major setback of the phone. Rest everything is fine as expected from a typical samsung phone. I gave 5 stars so that this would come in the top of review section.

  Samsung has done a decent job on M31.

Low-light testing is still not done.sAMOLED does its job as promoted by Samsung. Cell is little heavy due to it 6000 mAH battery but you can used to it over a period of time.

Best all rounder budget phone
",4,"

  The phone is best for both the students and the commoners. As I am a student, this phone is apt for everything. The biggest selling point of this phone is that it has got a 6000 mAh battery capacity which could go for at least 2 days with all the full usage of the phone. So people always search for pros and cons of a particular device. This thing has also got some of them.Pros:1. The massive battery capacity 6000 mAh is enough to attend all your live classes, do all your assignments and even some good gaming.2. The screen size is very good. Not too big neither too small. It's in between. So the phone is very handy and useful.3. The 64 MP camera is I think the best camera in the world. Compiling it with macro and ultarwide this phone is a camera beast in itself and can take some awesome night shoots as well as potraits.4. Both the fingerprint sensor and face id is fast enough. Unlocks the phone in no time and locks the phone as the screen goes off.5. This thing can do some pretty performance in gaming. Its not a gaming phone but can handle it like a pro.6. This phone has also got Dolby Atmos which can work only through Bluetooth devices but when paired up it produces a good music quality.Cons:1. This thing has a plastic back which invites a lot of fingerprints, grudges and scratches on the back of the phone.2. Does not provide a case in the box. You have to purchase it seperately.3. To charge a 6000 mAh battery the box provides only a 15w of charger which takes like 3 full hours to charge this thing up.4. It does not have samsung pay nor it has bixby. So that makes the phone not to be used in payments.5. Does not come with an earphone in the box. Though it has a 3.5mm headphone jack but still you have to purchase it seperately.But I think this phone is preety darn good. It can handle anything from classes to gaming to assignments to voice calls. Even it's speaker is good even if you are not using Bluetooth headsets.

Detailed review. Hope it helps :)
",5,"

  Really good product.. been using for a couple of week right now.Let's look at this in a good fashioned Pros/Cons manner shall we?..Pros :1. Super Amoled Screen : The super Amoled screen is a blessing in disguise and its one of those things that you don't know you needed until you get it.. after using this phone or any samsung phone with sAmoled screen you would be really disappointed with any other phone you get purely because of the screen quality.. I've watched and rewatched many movies in my phone as the quality is literally mesmerizing which just couldn't be achieved by my laptop screen.2. Camera : Goes without saying that the camera is really good. By default it does not use 64mp camera as pictures taken in 64mp have really large sizes but you can change the camera quality to 64mp from within the  camera app.. the photo quality is similar to the category of iPhones/Pixels as in the camera is more lifelike and 'real' rather than the oppo/vivo immensely beautified camera.. super slow motion, super stable mode, 4k video capture are really good functionalities if you're into that sort of thing.3. Performance : 6gb ram is really good and the samsung processor with android 10 os properly optimizes the phone to perform  various operations simultaneously without overheating problem.4. Gaming : I consider myself as a casual gamer and have faced no lag in any game that I've played even in really high graphics settings(in games like PUBG, Call of Duty, Asphalt 9, Sky, etc)5. Fast Charging : the 15W fast charging adapter charges the phone very quickly so you don't have to wait and stare at the wall while waiting for your phone to charge for too long.6. Design : I've got the space black model and saying that the overall design combining the screen, edges, back design, camera placement, etc is stunningly gorgeous would be an understatement.7. Made in India and Not a Chinese Company : Samsung is a south Korean company with its biggest headquarters in Noida.Many more pros but This review is getting kinda lengthy...so now ConsCons:1. Battery: Not really a major con as the battery is actually really good and lasts for a long time but still it doesn't quite feels like the 6000mAh battery advertised.2. Apps Hide: you can hide the apps from the menu but you can't truly hide an app as it can be searched from the search bar (maybe there is a different option to hide but so far I couldn't find one like the other Samsung mobiles)3. 14-15 volume level gap : the audio volume gap from level 14 to level 15(max) is kinda high and sometimes it's tough to find a sweet spot.These are the only cons that I've come across till now.Final Review : I would definitely suggest everyone to get this phone just for the sAmoled screen only. All the pros definitely outweigh the cons and for this budget this phone is a definite must buy.. I've used other phones in this price range too like the pocoX2 etc and trust me this phone is far better than anyother phone in this price range..If you are looking to buy a phone in this price range or even in a little higher price range you should get this phone as it won't disappoint.

  Best phone as compared with Chinese Mi Note9pro. My frnd bought Note9pro and his views are ki Samsung is far better quality wise compare to his Mi. Order second one for me. After a week use it’s just working great. I don’t know why people are giving negative review for camera or battery. Both are just perfect for 15k price. Definitely a must buy for this price.

  Display is awesome. Even though you won't feel much heavy on your hand, thickness could have been reduced. Samsung should look into its Form factor. Back panel looks very poor and old styled. Rear camera is good except macro. But lot of improvements and options are needed in front camera.. it has 32 MP camera which can do a lot better job than what's provided. At least portrait mode should have been included with artificial light settings. White balance is also toward warmer side. Battery life is like 3500 mah. No extra hours than Vivo v11 which I was using before.

Another compelling budget Galaxy phone
",5,"

  When Samsung launched the Galaxy M30s last year, we were shocked to see how competitively the company had managed to price the phone. The M30s instantly made the Galaxy A50 feel too costly, and rightly so: Except for the in-display fingerprint sensor and better looking design, the Galaxy A50 was pretty much the same phone as the M30s, only with a considerably smaller battery.Samsung could simply have let the 6,000 mAh battery on the M30s be the highlight, but it didn’t. The Galaxy M30s had the new Exynos 9611 processor under the hood, a 48MP triple camera setup at the back, and a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.However, since the battery life and display quality on the M30s were pretty top notch for the asking price, Samsung has focused on the camera experience with the Galaxy M31. There’s a 64MP camera at the back along with a macro camera, in addition to an ultra-wide camera and a depth sensor, while the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a 32MP sensor. Does the M31 have what it takes to be the amazing value proposition that the Galaxy M30s was last year? Let’s find out!Galaxy M31 design and displayThe Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that’s pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there’s a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn’t feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone’s liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ’64 megapixels’ mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. However, since this is the same panel as the one on the Galaxy M30s, the bezels are rather big for a 2020 smartphone. The bottom bezel in particular is an eyesore, though I guess we can’t complain considering the M31’s price tag.The Galaxy M31 has a headphone jack, for those wondering. But you will have to buy your own headphones, as there are no earphones in the box. There’s no case, either: All you get is a USB-C cable and a 15W Samsung fast charger, which was also the case (no pun intended) with the Galaxy M30s. You will need a case, though, if you want to keep the phone in a pristine condition, as the back panel picks up scratches very easily.Galaxy M31 cameraThe M31 is Samsung’s cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There’s plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.It’s the nighttime performance where the M31 drops the ball. First off, the phone simply has too much shake even when you hold it in two hands, and with a single hand, well, good luck getting a perfectly clear picture. If you do manage it, you get sufficient detail and little noise when there’s good artificial lighting around. In the dark, things aren’t so rosy. Samsung is marketing the M31 as having an amazing camera Night mode, but that Night mode isn’t exactly that great.First off, the Night mode photos are cropped considerably so you see a lot less in the frame compared to standard photos. Secondly, Night mode photos have a watercolor painting effect and often have their detail smudged when it should be the other way around. Finally, some scenes don’t show noticeable difference when captured in Night mode. Night mode is great for brightening up a scene when it’s too dark, but otherwise, it doesn’t really work as well as Samsung would make you think.Here are a couple of photos captured both in auto mode and in Night mode:The ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s’ ultra-wide camera. It’s useful to capture a wider scene, but don’t expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it’s great if you love taking close-up shots, though it’s often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots.For selfies, the Galaxy M31 has a 32MP camera and manages to take pleasing pictures outdoors. By default, you get 8MP photos, but you can switch to 32MP mode if you like to see more details in your selfies. At night, detail is lost whether it’s an 8MP photo or a 32MP photo, and you can also expect some camera shake if you don’t hold the phone steady using all the willpower you can muster.In case you’re wondering, you can capture 4K videos with the front camera as well. Other camera features include Live Focus mode for bokeh shots with the front and rear cameras, which works pretty well most of the time (see some samples below). You can also capture Super Slow-mo and standard slow motion videos and create AR Emojis. Standard modes like Hyperlapse and Panorama are present as well.Galaxy M31 performanceThe Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It’s the processor choice for Samsung’s budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use. The M31 runs smoothly as long as you don’t try to switch apps and browse through the user interface too quickly. Apps mostly launch quickly, and since there’s 6GB of RAM on both the 64GB and 128GB storage variants, multitasking isn’t usually an issue.Gaming performance is pretty good in titles like Call of Duty and PUBG, at least at the default graphics settings. The phone can stutter here and there when you initially load a game and start playing, but those stutters don’t show up after the first minute or two. It also didn’t have issues running well at the ultra frame rate setting in PUBG, and games like Asphalt 9 and Modern Combat 5 also run fine. This is something I also noticed on the Galaxy A50 and M30s – the Exynos 9610/9611 isn’t great for the general user interface, but its Mali-G72 MP3 GPU handles popular gaming titles very well.Galaxy M31 softwareLike every other Galaxy phone Samsung has launched in 2020, the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box. Well, it runs One UI Core 2.0, which is a stripped down version of One UI 2.0 that Samsung also brought to the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30 with the Android 10 update. You don’t get features like the built-in screen recorder or even something as basic as Secure Folder. Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini aren’t supported, either. Bixby is completely missing as well, except for Bixby Vision in the camera app.And when I pressed Samsung about why the M series runs One UI Core even though devices like the M30s and M31 have the same processor as the Galaxy A51, which do get standard One UI 2.0 (though not with all features), I was told the company designs each phone according to the target market. But that doesn’t explain why stuff like Samsung Pay Mini and Secure Folder aren’t part of the package, and I can only assume Samsung wants to keep some features exclusive to costlier phones.Since the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 out of the box, it will receive an update to Android 11 and Android 12 at some point. Android 11 might arrive quickly – the Galaxy M20 and M30 received the Android 10 update before the Galaxy Note 10 did, after all. Security updates are likely to come once every three months for the first two years, and whenever necessary from the third year onward.Galaxy M31 battery lifeWith a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it’s no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won’t have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.The M31 supports 15W fast charging. With such a big battery, faster charging speeds don’t matter that much, and given the price point Samsung is targeting with the M series, we probably won’t see the fast charging specification change any time soon. Still, it would be nice to have, as a full charge from 0 takes around two hours and a half. An hour of charging takes the charge to around 30 percent, though that 30 percent does last a considerable while.Galaxy M31 audio and call qualityThe M31 has a single bottom-firing loudspeaker that gets the job done if you’re in a small room but is too quiet to hear even at full volume otherwise. It’s the same story with every budget Galaxy phone, and the M31 doesn’t do anything to change that. Like the M30s’ speaker, the M31’s doesn’t distort at the highest volume, though, which is a plus. It could just do with a bit more depth in the low frequencies (bass).For wired audio, you will need to opt for a third-party product as no earphones are bundled with the phone. When used with earphones from other budget/mid-range Galaxy smartphones, the M31 produces sound that is very heavy on the high frequencies (treble) but lacks punch in the lower frequencies. As for call quality, I noticed no issues with either of the two SIMs I was using, except for the fact that both the earpiece and the loudspeaker are on the quieter side and make it hard to hear what the person on the other end is saying.Galaxy M31 verdictThe Galaxy M31 is more or less a Galaxy M30s with a macro camera, a higher-resolution main camera, more RAM on the base variant, and newer software out of the box. And the Galaxy M30s’ base variant, priced at Rs 12,999, is the better pick if you’re on an extremely tight budget. If you have Rs 14,999 lying around, then the Galaxy M31 offers excellent value for money. It would have been nice to see more feature-packed software, better quality from the 64MP rear camera in low light, and perhaps an Infinity-O display with smaller bezels, but for the asking price, these are all nitpicks that shouldn’t affect your decision to get the phone.

Detailed Review...

  Personally as a user i am using this phone for past few weeks as surprisingly this phone is best value for money...First of all the Display is best highlight of this phone obviously Samsung AMOLED are best in the market and this phone have that display,so no complaint for the display. It measures 159.2 mm x 75.1 mm x 8.9 mm and weighs 191 grams. The screen has a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403 ppi pixel density. It has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and screen-to-body ratio of 83.92 %...Secondcamera-the main sensor is 64mp Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1 sensor along with an f/1.8 lens. The camera setup has also an 8-megapixel secondary sensor with an f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle lens that comes with a field of view (FoV) of 123 degrees -- alongside a 5-megapixel macro shooter that has an f/2.4 aperture and a 5-megapixel depth camera with an f/2.2 aperture. There is support for Live Focus for an enhanced bokeh effect. Samsung has also provided dedicated night mode, super steady mode, and super slo-mo (using interpolation).You can record 4k at 30 fps. It has super steady mode for video recording which stabilize the video quite nicely.It has a dedicated Night mode for the night shot too.It Has 32mp selfie camera with AR doodle capabilities and also you can record slow motion video from the front camera.Overall good Camera performance in this price range.ThirdPerformance-Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant .Directly if we talk about PUBG it can Handle HDR with Ultra FPS.But prefer to play on HD at ULTRA FPS.Overall this phone is truly made for Indians and the best point is that this phone is manufactured in india.The Galaxy M31 has two Nano-SIM slots and has support for 4G as well as VoLTE. It also supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. Storage is expandable by up to 512GB.On the software front, Samsung ships the new Galaxy M31 with OneUI 2.0 on top of Android 10. The software is similar to what we have seen on the recently launched Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite. We did find a fair amount of bloatware on Galaxy M31. Apart from the Google apps, Netflix, Facebook, Candy Crush Saga, and Samsung Max were preloaded on the smartphone. Samsung also has its own apps such as My Galaxy and Samsung Shop.

Review Of Samsung Galaxy M31
",4,"

  Battery:-The battery has a capacity of 6000mAh which sounds good and has fast charging (15w). But the problem that I face most of the time is that my phone gets heated up while it is on charging or even while I'm using the normal applications or gaming. The company claims that the battery can last upto two days after one time charging while you are not gaming or surfing for a long time. But again I face a problem here even when I'm using some of the common apps, sharing hotspot or gaming the battery lasts for about only 24hrs. In short the battery drains fast.Performance :-Performance wise the Samsung galaxy M31 is very good product. It does not hang or lag while gaming or using apps. The touch response is very good. I don't face problem's while using multiple apps at once and it does not have any problems while switching the apps and also while normal gaming. The fingerprint sensor located on the back of the phone also works quite fast in unlocking the device.Camera:-The camera quality is good. It has all the necessary requirement and amazing camera features like Pro camera, Panorama,Macro,Food, Night,Slow motion and Super slow motion videos and even Hyperlapse which is quite good features. We can use most of this features on the selfie camera mode aswell. There is also a problem that I face with the selfie camera that is the camera has a bit of yellowish appearance. Other than this all the other features are good.Display:-According to me the display of Samsung galaxy M31 is good. Because I have used quite all the types of phone's and I felt that the M31 has good quality of display compared to the phone's that I have used before.Design:-The design of the Samsung galaxy M31 is so beautiful. The smooth edges and the round corners which makes the phone comfortable to hold while taking selfies and while normal uses as well . It's very light weight compared to the other phones that I have used.

  The product was phenomenal but it's look like a quite expensive may be 8 gb ram with 128 gb combination would be perfect to buy this one and curved display was fantastic. At last , I would rate battery 9.5/10, camera as 9/10, Curved display 10/10.Over all rating 9.5/10I would suggest you to buy if you are looking for 6 gb ram one.Hope it will be helpfull😉

Battery backup is really great.. with 50% battery phone can handle daily life tasks (with moderate social media usage) for more than 10 hours.. Thats better than other phone brands in same price range.. I got my phone delivered on time within 3days.. I was cautious when I saw the less packaging by Amazon.. Packaging is not sufficient for costly mobiles.. Well, I got my phone in superb condition.. Samsung Box was sealed packed & Phone is brand new, manufactured in September 2020..

Best device under 19K.
",5,"

  Overall its a good value for money device with a monstrous 6000 mAh battery 64 MP quad camera along with a 32 MP selfie camera. The Exynos 9611 SoC can handle most of the intense graphic games effortlessly. The OS does not load any ads unless the user chooses to. The privacy management is User centric where we can manage app data participate in marketing and advertisement etc.. .Users even can opt to receive ads the revenue from it is linked to users samsung account which can be donated to UN missions based on the users choice. This device (and most of M series devices) does not come with Knox security but still Samsung has provided many cryptographic modules and security applications to the device which makes it far more secure than other devices of same price segment.That said, the device though having a powerful AI backed Camera, Does not come with a fully featured Pro mode users cant even control shutter speed. Samsung likely provide it in future updates.Also the OS is ONE UI 2.0 Core thus some premium Samsung features are not available. The night mode is awesome and the video mode has electronic image stabilization. Some features like internet speed indicator and screen recording are absent, but can be managed with 3rd party apps.The game launcher is amazing providing good optimization for games. The battery is good and one can easily manage to get a 9 hr screen on time even with mild gaming. The device comes with built in Dolby Atmos audio which gets activated when the headphone is plugged in, and along with SuperAmoled display it is perfect for binge watching. Also it is Wide-vine l1 certified for streaming.

  Using this mobile for the last 5 months. It means I bought it just after launch 😁. My opinions about this mobile:* Found as expected or claimed by Samsung*Fast and accurate fingerprint reader, working even if there is some dust on fingers.*Normally I don't use camera for hobby, only for scanning office documents and it clicks very clear details.*After office hours I stream videos from different apps and battery helps me to watch.* Inbuilt Samsung VPN is also helpful.*Samsung UI is simple and not messy like other brands.* I missed to buy Samsung care due to no full information.* In last 3 months I found that the device automatically restarts anytime without doing anything, but now everything is OK. Don't know why...

Impressive camera, display, and speed
",5,"

  Impressed with the camera and the screen. What I loved the most is M31's macro lens, it is impressive. The overall camera is great, 64 mp main camera gives amazing picture and the amoled screen shows the true colors, and the best part of camera is its pro mode, I can manage the ISO and white balance. The of of the phone is not that bas as it looks online, I really loved the design and back cover too, although, MI note 9 max pro looks better from behind.And those who are worry about the speed, let me tell you, Samsung M31 is not going to upset you. I have used it for almost a week, and I didn't see any lags. It is fast, smooth, and I'm in love with the camera, colours, and screen.However, there are a few things that can be upgraded. The first thing is, there is no light indicator for Charing. Another are, fingerprint sensor, if they had given it on on the power button, it will be a better option. Display is a bit narrow, it should have been a bit wide as per the size. And, what should be the must part is, there should be more options for natural colors mode. Vivid colors seem a bit harsh on red.What I disliked is the battery and charging time. M31 takes really long time to charge, and battery drains so fast. It doesn't seem it has 6000 mah battery, however,  from 10 to 40 percent it take less time to charge, but as it goes up, charging slows down.Overall, it's quite a good option in this price segment, and can give a tough competition tk redmi, realme, vivo, and oppo.

Awesome phone with pack of features

  I have been using M31 since March 2019. I am quite impressed by it's features. First of all I would like to mention the battery back up. This phone saves me from carrying extra weight of power-bank. Fingerprint sensor is well responsive. There is no problem in reading under even direct sunlight. Amoled screen is excellent. Watching videos on this device is really great. Sound quality is superb. Dolby Atmos technology gives almost theatre like experience. External speaker is good. Rear camera quality is fine but front camera is not satisfactory. I can't give five out of five because of the performance of the front camera. Build quality meets my expectation. Surprisingly the phone is not heavy but robust and it feels premium.

  Designed and Manufactured in India tag gives head start.ProsThis phone is a power house, literally. The best thing is the battery seems like last for ever. One charge, and use it whole day with blue tooth and GPS ON, still at the end of the day, you will be left with 70% charge. That's huge. With 6000 mAH battery, the phone doesn't feel like heavy or bulky either. great.Great screen quality, big screen, amazing cameras (total 5 cameras), huge RAM & Storage (6GB & 128 GB). Ticks all the right boxes. Can't ask for anything more at this price point.ConsSome minor bugs in the software. Knowing Samsung for long, normally they resolve all these bugs within first six months. So hoping the same with this one too. Not a great responsive finger print sensor,  but I normally prefer pattern.ConclusionCan't get better than this. GO FOR IT

  People who are buying this phone just simply go for it. If you're looking for a camera phone and a phone that lasts you longer it's definently a great choice. The ""fingerprint reader"" sometimes doesn't work when the hand is moist or something but it's fine. The phone's also a little slippery in the hand so I'll recommend buying a case with it as soon as you get it. Overall I'd say a great purchase.

Great phone. It is worth buying it.
",1,"

  It has been nearly 4 months since I purchased this phone and never has it shown any sign of problem.  The battery life of this phone is extraordinary which easily lasts a day and half with heavy usage and two days easily normally. Many products make false claims but samsung has clearly kept its word in this aspect. Due this factor, the phone may seem heavy but when it is compared to other smartphones which have the same battery life, M31 is a clear winner. The camera quality of the 64 MP rear camera is also too good with sufficient quality and to some extent. The night mode feature and the macro mode feature is the best on this phone. The 32 MP selfie camera is also really good for a budget phone where the image is visible in detail.Coming to the fingerprint reader, recognition is satisfactory with standard reaction time. Like any other phone which has finger print reader, this phone too doesn't recognize when your hands are moist.The two features this phone can improve on is the face recognition which is surprisingly poor for a samsung phone and the sound quality. The sound quality is not too less or too loud either.To sum up the samsung m31 is a really great phone and it comes with a lot of great features for this price. I guarantee that it is definitely worth your money and a cool phone to have. I would give this phone a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.

It is a MONSTER!!

  One of the best phone which I personally used. This phone comes up over my expectations. This has perfect look which increases this phone's  aesthetics.  Lightweight  which makes it easy to handle. When e comes over the display to is awesome. Large display. The fingerprint reader is pretty good to. The quality of the sensor I can feel it. Moreover  the battery life. I charge my phone  once a day . Which will last up to 22-23 hours. The only problem is the fast-charging. But I'm very satisfied with its performance. I can use 6000mh battery upto 23 hours and charges for 2 and a half hour. Now let's talk about the camera. Simply perfect. 64 mp main gives me perfect shots when need. While comes to wide-angle shot it makes difference in quality.  But overall camera is good. Live-focus makes the photo live. Macro shots are awesome to. Quad camera is perfectly arranged to in this place. Strong flash to. It can also use as strong flashlight in the night. Wait I just forget to tell about camera options, Samsung provides more options like macro, pro, night, panaroma, slowmo, super-slowo, hyperlapse  and food which gives you complete satisfaction. And budget is perfect. For a mid-range customer Samsung M31 is perfect and would be the best choice for you under 19,000. It is actually a monster!!!. King of mid-range phone's. Processors is not like other Samsung phones. M31 has less lag. Faster. Speakers are very loud and clear. Under 20,000 the best phone you can get when look to battery, processor, camera, and data your personal data security. You can trust Samsung.  This trust gives us M31 the real monster in this range. No phones from other companies can compete with it in battery under this range. It is actually a MONSTER!!!

A review after months' usage, read it to know the truth behind this phone
",5,"

  I am writing this review after using the phone for a couple of months. Here is what I have to say.1. Battery:- The hype for this phone was about the battery and camera. This battery I would say will give you a day's time to do whatever you want. I have done heavy gaming, listened to music videos, called, surfed internet and still the battery longed for a full 24 hour. Some times more. So a good one, 4 stars.2. Camera :- A 64 megapixel back camera, along with 3 more cameras at the back for macro, wide angle and many more quality functions. I am pleased with the front camera as well. So a four star only because the 64 mega pixel could have been a bit more clear and effective. But I won't complain since I am not a photographer.3. Display :- Best in the market. Eyes closed, a five star, you won't get any better. Best cinematic experience ever.4. Audio :- I have heard people complaining about the audio being bit low, but I found the speakers to be quite loud and more importantly crystal clear. Samsung has given a built in Dolby atmos feature for ultimate audio experience when connected to earphones or bluetooth devices. It is just fantastic. A five star for overall audio experience.5 :- Processor and phone speed :- It is all good, nice speed while gaming in medium graphics, and using multiple apps, works just fine except a couple of times I have faced genuine lag while using the keyboard. The default keyboard, the phone just stops for a minute, and I have to lock it and unlock it again to make it work. I was sad to see that, hoping it is a keyboard issue and not a processor issue. Otherwise an overall 3.5 stars for the speed.Overall it is a ideal phone to buy within the range as you would never get such artistic amoled display, and audio, with a great battery life and medium phone speed.So go ahead. Get yourself a Samsung M31 now!

  Actually its a nice phone but its battery backup is not upto the mark of 6000mah i thinks it have the power of 4000mah onlyCamera is good not really good they could have use the sony sensor in the camera samsung sensor is not upto the markAnd the chipset used exynos 9611 is a average chipset they could have use the qualcomm snapdragon 730G for getting a good processing now the m31s is available in the market i was mistaked i should have wait for the samsung galaxy M31s and should have purchased that because it has the qualcomm snapdragon chipset and its 6000mah battery and 25W fast charging come to the battery of this phone backup is good but charging is actually slow because it only have 18W fast charging to the 6000mah battery that is actually slow and it takes 3hr to battery fully chargedAnd its major pro is its screen the screen amoled display is really good and so cool to see

Best phone under budget category.  Super battery, Super good cameras, super good display
",4,"

  Awesome phone under this price category.  Battery life is just stunning.  Performance is very good.  The amoled display with the dark mode looks very astonishing.An issue which i noted was with the pop up and split screen. Usually it just works fine but if the phone gets heated due to multi tasking and prolonged use then you can't see the pop up view or split screen for any application.  I think this maybe a bug with the one ui 2.0 which will be corrected in future updates. You'll get to see pop up view and split screen options within 10 to 15 mins if the phone is idle. So don't worry about it.Note: please note that phone is not heating suddenly but only after prolonged use for about 4 to 5 hours of calling,  gaming,  multi tasking, etc. I

  I have always used samsung phone, my previous one was j7 recently I bought m31. Fully satisfied.....It has superb 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display and it offers good brightness levels , so I didn't find any issues 😌 reading the screen under bright sunlight. The FHD+ screen is sharp and delivers crisp video content in 1080p resolution, So I can easily stream content on Netflix and Amazon Prime video in full HD resolution 😄. It comes with 6000 mAh battery, So I can use the phone for a long time say upto two days just on a single charge😱 I am very happy about it...😁and  15 w charger which supports fast charge standard. If I talk about camera it has quad rear cameras with a combination of 64-megapixel main camera,an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera , a 5-megapixel depth camera , and 5-megapixel macro lens, there’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras  and it is very good and at the front, there is a 32-megapixel selfie camera and I am very satisfied with its camera performance😌😌😌 video quality is good I can shoot in full 4K resolution. But I am worried about its plastic back if I didn't use a back cover I'm pretty sure  it will get a lot of scratches 😰 and start loosening  colour over time🥺😢 and everyone knows about the heating issues of its processor😖  but overall it's really very good  if you are looking for a phone under 20000 then no doubt it is the one you should go for...  It will not disappoint you .

  After using this device for 1 monthPros1.Best Display in the segment (exception it does not have higher screen refresh rate)2. Good battery (even with full day usage 20-30% still remains)3.camera is good (front and rear both are good but the ultra wide is only 5mp and it produce very bad result in low light, portrait mode or live works good)4. It’s a reputed brand and also as we are boycotting Chinese so it’s good optionCons1. Battery charging time too much as it have only 15 watt charger and battery is huge2. Very buggy Phones3. Performance is very bad it’s worst as compare to Redmi or Realme phone in its segment4. Slows down even in chrome browser5.back made of plastic get lot of scratchesVerdictDo not buy this phone I also changed the device after 1 month of use as this device hangs a lot don’t go with YouTube reviews or antutu benchmarks even when i was writing the review the phone closed the chrome so I wrote this from my iPhone so if you want a good display and battery then you can buy it#sorry for bad English but the review is correct please use someone m31 before you buy this

If you want a best smartphone in this segment go for it without any hesitation.

   Ah, what a phone with massive 6000 mAH battery and mindblowing camera. BTW, if you want a good smartphone in this segmentI will highly recommend this phone. Go for it.So, first of all ,  Thank You amazon for delivering so fast even in thelockdown. I wasn't expecting such a quick delivery. Since, I don't live in a metro city.Pros:1. Samsung Exynos 9611(10 nm) processor (Best for gaming)2. Massive 6000 mAH battery (Charge stay upto 1.5 days easily with hardcore gaming)3. Super Amolded 6.4 inch display(1080X2340 pixels) with Corning gorila glass 3 protection4. Fast charging5. 4 back camera with flash 64 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/1.72"", 0.8µm, PDAF 8 MP, f/2.2, 12mm (ultrawide), 1/4.0"", 1.12µm 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro) 5 MP, f/2.2, (depth)6. Dedicated face recognition scanner which actually works in the DARK.7. Video recording done on 4k@30fps8. Sound quality is too goodCons:1. Plastic back pannel ( I won't say really this a con but it feels just like metal to be honest)2. Charging cable is too short3. Headphone is not available in the boxFor your phone protection buy a hard case & the cover too.

  Its really a solid device with stunning processing capabilities and flexible powers. Gaming experience  is really quite fantabulous and sampled display is also quite good. Sound quality is not the best in class but quite good. Only drawbacks  are you could feel the phone getting  heated up after gaming (mostly when playing heavy games like PUBG Mobile or COD) and the device feels a bit heavy in hand. Overall  the build quality  is fantastic  with a super fast physical fingerprint scanner and the quad-camera system performs  quite well in daylight  and the focus is also brilliant (both back and front camera). Again it's not the best for night captures yet you can't say it's bad. The 6000 Mah battery doesn't feel like it's one though lasts all day if you aren't that a heavy user. Fast charging  is also superb, I must say. I think it's quite the budget smartphone from Samsung you should go for!

  first of all I ordered the mobile on 17th july and I get my hands on 23rd it is such a long time but during this pandemic this is not a huge deal.I 'm writing this review after the three days of usage.pros:-1) display - the amoled display is always the top of display segment. As usual a best display from samsung the colours are vivid and punchy.2) battery - really this is the monster in battery segment it comes with the huge 6000 mAh battery which easily stands for 1 day in heavy usage for light usage it may stand more than 2 days.3)UI - as that the Ui is personal opinion . the one UI have retained the stock os without bulk bootlogger .4)camera- when i buy i used to see reviews my reviews were that performance of camera is not upto the mark.But the device comes with 16mp mode as default that the 64mp use huge storage, so whenever it is necessary u  may switch to 64 mp mode. the pic was crisp and natural.5) RAM management- i bought 8gb varient and i didn 't face any reloading or reopening of apps while switching.cons:-1) built - the built quality is not that premium as they  used plastic insted of glass.but there is no creeking or worse . they used plastic to maintain the weight of device below 200gm.2)Protection- the device comes with corning gorilla glass 3 in front. at this price segment many others offer 6.3)processor - it comes with exynos 9611 processor . this is not that worse processor, this is best for day to day use and for games with light and medium settings (here the answer for many others question yes you can run pubg with meduim setting without and lag or framedrops and free fire can be run in ultra graphics without any lags) overall with processor it is best for light gamers not for intense gamers and also here the display again make the gameplay next level.4)accessories - first it comes with 15w fast charge support it takes 1 and 1\2 hr to get full in fast charge on and takes 3 hr in fast charge off mode. but i personally recommend to charge without fast charge .that makes a notable difference in battery standby. and one more thing it is difficault to drain this battery to 0.  as back is plastic it easily picks the fingerprint and smugdes easily and that samsung haven't gave their tpu case here and it is very importent to use the case.  This is the detailed review that i have made for u to make your choice . and i hope it will be usefull to the internet shopping surffers.  at last in disclaimer i request to record the video of unboxing that will be useful while any defect or missing or change of product. so be careful . happy purchase..  i 'm happy with what i bought..

  Awesome Cameras- Perfect companion for all your photography needs. All the 4 cameras has got terrific skills to bring up exotic pictures.Great Battery life- Expect upto 1.5 days of battery life if you are a casual user but do note that as this phone only supports 15W fast charging it would take around 3hrs to fully charge the device from 0-100.Super Amoled display gives an exotic viewing experience as usual found in Samsung phonesGreat memory management which easily handles the apps in the background without being killed.The One UI 2.0 makes it a clean and cool gadget.Concluding I would like to say that if you are looking for a smartphone with Great Cameras, Battery life, display then the Samsung Galaxy M31 is made for you.I can say it's the safest android phone at the price point where it comes with no bloatwares or ads in unlike the Chinese mobile brands.Like the name suggests it's a Monster in Camera, Battery & Display.It's also light weight when compared though it has got a massive 6000Mah battery.I don't play games on phone so can't say about thatI have been using the 6GB RAM+128GB Storage since one month, and in my experience I am in love with this Monster #SamsungGalaxyM31

An awesome phone for professionals
",5,"

  An awesome phone, with an absolutely excellent display and UI.Pros- Best display in range (and even beyond). The super Amoled display not only provides a vibrant display but also provides great viewing angles and the colors on the screen really come out well. Plus, the Always on display is a unique and impressive feature though not much useful.- Samsung's OneUI is a pleasure to use. Lots of features, easy management of apps and notifications. Adding to that, Android 10 experience is also really good.- Battery life is much more than sufficient. Even after heavy usage and extensive video/audio playing, it lasts a bit more than a day. It sure does take some time to charge but that's worth the wait as the phone lasts for about two days with normal use and one complete day with heavy usage.- Camera clarity is good and provides a lot of modes, for shooting stills and videos.- Non-Chinese brand :')Cons- Not the fastest charger in the segment.- The back panel is plastic, which does not look as premium as other phones in the price segment, but since I use a back cover anyway it doesn't matter much.- I don't do much gaming but from other reviews, it seems it doesn't perform as good.- That's pretty much it.Go for it. A great phone for working professionals who aren't into gaming and need their phone for texting, content watching and basic management tasks.

Best battery backup I've seen in a while.
",4,"

   I bought this phone for my mother and she is very happy with the device. The biggest reason I choose this was the massive battery and the battery life it offers. It even lasts 2 days without any charge on casual usage.  The camera quality is good in day light and in well lit environments but not in low light.  The UI is quite simple and the display quality is great. I'd choose an 60Hz panel with good color quality over a 120hz with bad color reproduction anyday.Overall, this phone is a great choice for those casual users who want a device with  great battery life and display.

  samsung m31 is a great phone with good battery and average performance still its one of the best phone in this price segmentcamera is cool but samsung has to improve in ultrawide photos.ultrawide camera is average but the normal 64mp cam is just mindblowingone could easily say that it is the best camera phone under 20k.the performance in this phone is average in terms of gaming but its best for daily usage the massive 6000mah battery is best it could only withstand one to one and half days.charging time is approx 2-3 hrs talking about thlhe build quality,its actually a slightly heavy phone but its really handy and weight managemnt is actually pretty good,it just survived a fall from my pocket without any scratch and the display is really superboverall the phone is just awesome in terms of camera and display iam not a die hard gamer so its the best for me.Playing high end games like pubg is a difficult task because it has heating issues

EXCELLENT DISPLAY,BATTERY LIFE,CAMERA

  I have used Samsung M31 since last 8 days, below is feedback hope it is helpful for people who are confused to buy this or equivalent Redmi/Oppo/Realme & other chinese brands phone.1. Excellent Display: The phones display & touch is excellent, very fluent to use, had a wonderful experience binge watching my favourite webseries/movies youtube videos.Also gaming experience is best on the this screen size.2. Excellent sound on speaker & headset as well,enhances your movie watching.3. Battery: The best feature of this phone, i have used more then 1.5-2 days of heavy gaming,calling,movies watching on single charge with still some battery left. No warming issues at all on playing games such Pubg with high settings.4. Camera: Haven't explored all the camera features fully, but very satisfied on both Rear & Front cameras, as was worried after going through the reviews comparisons with other Chinese brand. Rear camera pics are wonderful in outdoors light, indoors is also satisfactory.Front Camera is best. Recorded video quality is very good.5. Brand: Cannot be more happier buying a Non-Chinese brand, if you are confused between this phone & other Chinese brand...without a doubt buy this, its all worth.6. Recommendation: Purchase a transparent silicon rear cover for phone, protect phone & also camera lenses.Also buy screen guard with 9H rating.

  Now this phones is not meant for those pubg freaks out there. Neither i am one of those.Camera 5/5Battery5/5Screen 5/5Build and looks 4/5Processor 4/5Now u cannot get everything. This phone is just perfect for my usage and i am very happy i bought it. Screeen quality is just awesum. No other phone has this screen quality in this price. Multi tasking and day to day usage, i did not find any problem and it is flawless. Casual gaming, u can do easily but not for heavy gamers. Camera quality is awesum, pics are a little over saturated but i wont complain, it enhances the beauty of the pictures. Battery easily lasts me 1.5 days on heavy usage. Sometimes 2 days on light usage. So who is this phone meant for. Poeple who have other important stuff than just using their device as a gaming console. U want a great phone? Close ur eyes and go for it.

  It has#awesome camera,#awesome battery life,#awesome display.At first week,charging was very slow that is it takes 5min - 10 mins for only 1 percent.so i contact the samsungThey gives the solution. Speed varies many times.after some days charging becomes normal that is 25%-75% it takes 1 and half an hour.but draining of the is not a simple task ,1 hour of free fire just reduce 8%-9% of battery.if Samsung add some features in camera, gesture and motion then it will be a awesome deal.Without these also it's good.Features needed:live internet speed monitor ,daily data usage limit, shake to torch,tap fingerprint sensor to capture on camera like thatBest features: night mode for front camera, 4k recording for front camera,swipe fingerprint sensor to pull notifications panel,ad-free UI  -SRIDHAR TRSv

  I bought the 128 storage one(space black).It's working really superb....The finger print reader reads urs very easily and very quick at its work.You can also add more than one fingerprint for recognition and among those any one u keep on sensor it unlocks ur phone..Coming battery part,its very very user friendly....u can use for full 48 hrs in one charging and it again refills its power within around 2 hrs from 0-100%.About Camera: it has got 4 at back with 64mp,13mp,5mp,5mp.its front one is of 32mp....this one is super cool....it gives  you wonderful pics for you and it also have some inbuilt special features in camera which you would really want to use then such as slow motion ones and all....Now if you want me to tell about 64mp camera, it can give you crystal clear pictures...only thing is thatU could get to know about it when u use it...The other quality which I liked about the phone is its speaker...its really really good..and give you good sounding effects.The thing about which I was unhappy was the phone comes without screen guard and back cover...Other than that the phone is amazing and you can invest on this..if it's in your budget range...

  Performance of the phone is nice, camera quality is also great, but pictures are artificially blured, thought it has nice detailing. Supersteady mode in this camera is awesome , it also has electronic stabilization upto 1080p resolution no stabilization is provided to 4k recording. Having a massive Battery life of 6000mah, which lasts upto 9 to 10 hrs of continue use. Super amoled display gives a good vivid view and gives you best experience to watch movies or playing games. Playing pubg in high graphics gives lags and frame drops but in smooth graphics it's nice, you can play in extreme frame rate that's 60fps. It also have inbuilt game booster which also supports screen recording only for the games apps. After updating phone which has arrived on 25 July phone is heating and while charging and playing games or by doing  multitasking. Ram is so powerful that even if you run all the apps in background it doesn't reloads it, I have 8gb variant that's enough for heavy multitasking like playing games, video editing software and also social media apps. Back of phone is having a plastic body which gets dirty by using without back cover, finger Print marks appears after some use and also it gets scratches on it easily. Overall design is nice fits into hands comfortably. Since Samsung has to work on update and fix the heating problem.

  It’s to early to comment on the phone because we have start using it now anything which is new will be fine for couple of months and later start to exhibit the true behavior . QUICK feedback i can share is phone is good it’s for my mother i felt its bit heavy compare to my S10+. its really heavy i think because of battery.1. Screen is dam good i liked it videos & picture are good i rate 5.2. Some review said sound not good, but i like the sound its very good nice clarity & you get stereo effect3. Battery life is good at presentNOT LIKED:1. Buttons side and frame colour are same its bit hard to find it, they could have done bit better.2. Phone is heavyIMPROVMENT OR FEEDBACK TO SAMSUNG:1. Charge for accessories customer will pay. Like screen guard, cover, earphone etc. when they opt this it must get added in the box. Since it will be company manufactured it will suit the phone else we need to run around local shop with local manufacture were we see lots of issue.2. SAMSUN must take care of such issue to keep customer happy.At present this is what i have to say thanks all for readign my comments. Takecare

Best replacement for all mid-range Chinese smartphones

  At first I was a bit skeptic, with Exynos processors but this Exynos 9611 is really good. Images are sharp and Vivid. Maco is also good. Battery usually last 1-1.5 days on average usage, which includes Streaming songs, videos, and attending online meetings also. Network perception is really great. And the screen as you know its sAMOLED it is really great. Dolby Atmos is is pretty awesome when paired up with a decent earphone.And its UI is also really good, unlike any other smartphone brands you do not receive any unnecessary Ads and pop-ups.It is almost good as the Stock Android.As of now the recent security patch is of July.So I think security updates is also good.If you are a binge watcher like me, it's an ideal phone for you from Samsung.Or if you are average user who looking for a non-Chinese phone, it is the phone you would really appreciate.And this phone is manufactured in India, so it does support Make in India.Till now I have no regrets after buying this device.Previously I had Asus Zenfone Pro M1, it is really great and I loved stock Android.So there are very few bloatwares, most of them can be uninstalled or can be hidden.In fact I recommended this phone to some of my friends and they really loved it.

M31 - Excellent phone - No Network issues - Good battery, camera, awesome Display - Little heavy
",4,"

  My honest review from an iphone user (using iphone 6 now and used XS for an year). Wanted something simple yet powerful, good camera and more importantly battery backup in a reasonable cost.Pros:1. Battery, Camera (My first charge came for 2 full days and still 5% remained)2. No Lag, so pretty good processor (not a gamer)3. Awesome display.4. Powerful Andriod 10 features and samsung UI.5. Fast fingerprint display (Dont want to use face unlock and in display fingerprint)Cons:1. A bit heating while using camera or other heavy apps (may be I felt coming from iphone) but not much while charging. Negligible factor I would say.2. A bit heavy (again coming from iphone)3. Low light photography isn't that good.4. Call volume and speaker volume not sufficient.5. Charging a bit slow.Overall, a budget friendly SAMSUNG phone with good competition to always price increasing redmi phones with crap ads and fancy features.

  The phone has am amazing battery life, and best in class camera. The display is pretty great for the price. The contrast and colors you get from the FHD+ display is greate. The other thing the Samsung improved from the past phone is its software. The One UI is one of my favourite android UI right now. It is simpler and well organized and easy to use and has many handy features when you need it. The UI is designed such that the buttons on top are brought lower to the screen for easy access. It comes with a 15W charger which is pretty cool.The things that hold the phone back is its processor. Its slower when compared to its competition, so a smoother gaming is not it's strength (but performes decently during other tasks like opening multiple medium load apps). The back cover is made of plastic which looks like glass so it doesn't break easily, which is kind of a good thing but it looks less sleek because of that. But I am going to put a cover on it any way.  So it doesn't matter much to me. This phone is more of a media machine rather than a gaming phone. So this phone is more preferred for people who watch a lot of videos, surfs the web and plays music, kaes a lot of photos with their phone and takes calls. (The audio quality during call is pretty good.)

  This is a really good phone under 20k. After using for some weeks I have found out :Pros1. Really good Camera quality. There are 4 cameras and the primary one is 64 Mp.It also has slo mo and Bokeh features. Moreover it has a digital motion stabilization while recording video which means that slight wobbles and shaking won't come in the camera and the video would look cleaner.2. Battery: It has a 6000mAh battery. It always lasts around 2 days if you use the phone above moderate level. If you don't use your phone much, it will last way more than that.3. Performance: It was overall very smooth. Didn't lag at all during my use. Since it had 6gb ram it worked really smooth. Would Highly recommend if you want good performance.4. Display: The sAmoled display was really good. It has a really clear display. Moreover it has gorilla glass 3.05. Speakers : The speakers in the phone are really good. It has good sound quality.6.Wifi calling : It has the wifi calling feature which works well with my jio sim.7. Dedicated micro sd card slot. It has dual sim and a dedicated micro sd card slot.8. The phone is slightly heavy which makes it easy to hold .9. it has fast charge featureCons.1: The fingerprint sensor is not very fast. But still reasonably fast.2. Camera has a lot of options that make it slightly complicated. The 64 Mp mode won't be turned on initially so you will have to switch to it if you want. In the 64 M.P mode zooming is not there also it is in 3:4 aspect ratio. It's ok since you can crop it later. Also in night the picture quality won't be that good.3. Lack of I.R blaster is not much of a con4. Headphones are not included in the package.5. The charging time is around 2 hrs.Overall it's a really good option for the price. The pictures taken by the  camera may look like it was taken from a DSLR. No lags and really smooth. Highly recommended for this price.

If your looking for a decent phone with good screen ,UI, Battery life go for it

  Bought the m31 (6+128) both space black and ocean blue variants for me and my brother.here are my views about the device.Pros:1.Super amoled display which is more vibrant than IPS LCD pannels2.Stunning blacks Thanks to the Samsung's SAMOLED DISPLAY.3.Massive 6000 mah battery which lasts for around  1 and half to 2 based on our usage.4.super user friendly thanks to samsung ONEUI 2.0 the interface is too Good.5.come with android 10 out of the box.6.The quad camera setup is decent enough and there is some auto focus issue which I think may be corrected with an update.7.Decent performer for games like pubg,call of duty etc....8.Always on display is very useful and get done the task of notification LED ofcourse there is some battery drain because of this feature.But trust me it is very less than you expected.Cons:1.supports 15W fast charging only which make the total charge time to around 2h 30 mins .but remember the capacity is around 6000mah which take more time to charge.2.Design is too old as we are getting glass finish in other brands within this budget range.3.Need improvement in the speed of unlocking phone using biometrics.

  I've buy brought the 8gb+128gb varient.I've using this mobile for 10 days.. Here is the detailed review of my Galaxy m31:Pros:1. Super amoled display2. Monster battery3. Camera4. Processor is good for multiple tasking and gaming for short periods5. No heating issue during multiple tasking.Cons:1. Slow charger as it gives 15w charger. It will be fine if provides 30w charger. Btw it is not a issue anymore.2. Charging usb cable is less than 1 metre.3. The mobile getting heat when it is on the charging otherwisr no other heating problem.  If you're a moderate user and fun loving then you must go for this device. It's 8gb ram varient is super flexible for gaming. But its is recommended to not play game continuously for more than 2 hrs, it is not good for the mobile health as like your health too.

Best, durable smartphone under right price.
",5,"

  I am using this phone from 2.5 months & just want to tell you that this samsung phone's solid plastic/fibre body is very most durable ,not like xiaomi or oneplus phone's metallic body which suffers accidental bends or dents.Battery : Big(6000maH), can run for a complete day in one charge in avg. usage.Charging : charger is looking of less watt(15wt) but it is enough as it fastly charge 60% in 20 mins then 15-20 mins for 100%.Camera : Best quality 4 cameras - coming till now in smartphones, with selfie of 32 MP. you can see in images camera is not very bulging out(just slight out- safe) like in redmi note 9 pro max.Body : Glossy, descent look, single classy color, chances of scratch,dent,bend are very less as body is very solid smooth not very rough-metallic as in redmi note 4. You can compare it's durability test.User-Interface : Samsung is famous for this.Speed : You can compare it's speed test, i think very nice as it has 6gb ram.Storage : Good thing is, it is complete 128 gb not some less like usual.fingerprint sensor : Good response time.Only charger's cable is quite short :)This phone is coming under good price as it has all features of phones ranging around 27000.

  Perfect smartphone with all round performance .Battery life : Amazing !! On one full charge it  can easily last up to 1.5 even if use you  use it all day and on light usage can  easily last for around 3 days .Camera : One of the main highlights of this  phone . It is just superb whether it is in  inightvision or in day light or whether it  is the primary camera or selfie camera .Fingerprint sensor  : It is very good and  provides easy access to it within a  fraction of second.Display : If you are a smart phone I just dont  need to tell you about the experience of  super amoled HD display and more to it  Samsung's display are next level ( based  on my experience ) .Processor : Many would prefer Snapdragon  over Exynos but according to my experience  till date I haven't found much difference  between the two or rather I would say  that I have found Exynos slightly more  better than Snapdragon .At last I would just say if you are looking for a smartphone in range of 15 - 18 thousand you should consider Samsung's M31 , it's just magnificent .

  M31 best segment in this price range,, its fabulous..pros -1. Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome it's like a monster battery.2. Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.3. Android 10! best experience,,, it's work very well.4. It is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card.5. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.6. Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.con -1. With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.2 hrs for a full charge but i really satisfied.( charging could be faster)2. Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange.In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade.Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand.But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchas

Perfect for heavy users in an affordable price

  Great delivery by amazon! Purchased during the Independence day Freedom sale. Phone is excellent in terms of performance. Unlike other chinese models this one is manufactured in India. Samsung's OneUI is smooth without any lags. 6gb if RAM makes it a good run with a superb 64 mp rear camera. Front one is decent. I am using after using a Xiaomi note 6 pro. But Redmi's looks are updated where Samsung is far behind. Metal /glass body to these phones will make them superior in appearance to other chinese models. Maybe m31s will serve that purpose I guess. If you put a nice back cover to this, problem could be resolved by the way...

I loved this phone and everyone should read this review and should buy this mega monster.Pros:1. Good camera2. Big battery (Even it lasts 3 days and for standby it may lasts for 5 to 6 days)3. Big storage4. Super amoled display is lit.5. For gaming its beast(PUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop.)6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category.Cons:1. Slightly heats up while charging.I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.

Good phone at this price point
",5,"

  Hi, It is not a chinese product, so that was the main reason that I purchased this phone. Just wanted to get rid of my Red Mi Note 5 Pro asap. Coming to this phone, it is doing the job well for the price point that it comes in. In fact, I am more than happy and we have purchased 4 of these phones in last 6 months. I feel, fast charging is not fast enough as it is charging around 15% in 21 minutes. Battery is of 6000 mah, but it still seems less as I have to charge it in about 36 hours with moderate use. Other than these two points, phone is very good and I would recommend this phone to my friends and family.Thanks!

  Excellent alternative to many other brands. Performance  is very nice.MS office with Galaxy  series phones are very good combination and boon for youths and students. If we go for other smart phone brands you should either have office 365 subscription or need some other office suite to enjoy full functionality of office tools.Samsung's Email app UI very  nice.

Nice phone 👍👌
",4,"

  I am writing this review after almost 2months of usage.1. Display - 10/10I love the display bcoz of its colours, vividness, and above all black levels are just superb 👌😍2. Camera - 8.5/10Main camera is good, wide angle lens also however there is no use of macro lens for me but quality is good however it only captures images upto 5cm while others can take upto 2cm.I noticed one difference between main camera and ultra wide lens in sky photography that in normal mode image has colours as that of sky accordingly like orange, blue, reddish but in ultra wide lens the colours are overall.3. Battery 9/10For me it runs well (1.5 day) and charges within 2-3 hrs according to that level when I put it on charge.4. Performance 8.5/10I'm a casual user and for me it hasn't disappointed me yet. I play games like asphalt and it runs well however I haven't try pubg5. RAM management 9/10Verdict: I loved this phone. It hasn't disappointed me in any way but it get somewhat warmer during heavy usage and in hot environment however from the last software update I haven't noticed that yet. Considering its price point you'll not find it much premium but in usage you'll not be disappointed.

Best Phone in 15k
",5,"

  I have been OnePlus user and then an iPhone user. I was slightly hesitant to ditch these 2 brands as I found them to be highly reliable and user-friendly.After lot of research, I then finally bought Samsung M31 and it's been 2 months now. I feel I made the right decision to switch to Samsung.The overlaid OS is awesomely smooth and the graphic animations are pretty evolved to the extent of iOS. The camera is also top notch and build quality is pretty tough.The battery easily lasts me for 2 days with moderate usage.Overall an excellent phone for a power user and camera lover.

Nijit Agarwal,"
Samsung galaxy M31
",1,"

  There are some definite plus points about this phone:1. The BATTERY: Yeah, it's that big! The 6000mAh beast goes on for more than a whole day despite the continuous usage of internet (including Facebook, YouTube, Netflix etc.) Also, if you restrain from using the phone heavily while it's charging, the battery percentage goes from 20 to 100 within two hours.2. Camera: The 64 MP camera catches the details really well, although excess zooming may make the pictures appear pixelated.The wide angle lens gives a 123° view and sticks to the claims made. The main 64 MP camera has an autofocus, but allows manual focussing too.Macro 5 MP cam is a little disappointing as it captures unsatisfactory images in low light, but otherwise gives some great close-up shots.3. Processor: One needs to remember to do the software update once the phone is active. If not done so, you will certainly face lags even within the same app, not just while switching between different apps. Once that update is done, the phone runs ever so smoothly.P.S. I'm not a video game player, so wouldn't know anything about the speed of those operations.4. Space: There's no particular need, but 128gb basic ROM is more than sufficient to incorporate all your favourite music, small video clips as well as movie files in . mp4 or .avi formats.5. Fingerprint reader: You HAVE to cover the complete scanner area. Thankfully, the phone gives suggestions like ""cover the whole scanner"" and ""wipe off the water droplets"".The phone doesn't heat up much during charging, just gets a little warm and that seems normal.Overall, if you're looking for a budget phone with good specifications that's made in India, you wouldn't regret buying this model.

Excellent battery life, brilliant screen

  I bought this mobile for my mother-in-law. The main requirements were:- Large screen- Brilliant display- Long battery life- Ample storageThe Samsung Galaxy M31 met all of these requirements well. In the couple of months since purchase, the phone has performed well. What stood out was the battery. 6000 mAh easily lasts two days and more.The only downside is the bloatware. These apps can be deleted, but are unnecessarily installed before delivery.Delivery was done ahead of time, and during the Covid travel restrictions. Impressive!

The best phone within 20000

  Performance wise the phone is very good. Touch and fingerprint lock works within fraction of seconds. I had always been a BlackBerry fan for almost 10 years but switched to Samsung and am very satisfied with it. At 17000 rupees there couldn't be any better mobile than this.Battery life - 6000 mah battery has got you extra life if you keep your mobile data off then battery doesn't go down 20 in 70 hours. With all function enabled 1 35-40 hours you need to recharge.Gaming experience- not a very used to game on the phone but even if you are It won't disappoint you.Camera quality- camera is also good at this budget.

  The Phone Is excellent for all the things which you can think of doing in daily life.Best camera in this price range.Battery is outstanding,there is no phone around it in battery department.Display is also very beautiful,color accuracy and brightness is top.I had played some games in this phone and that also works perfectly fine but you cannot play heavy games for more than 1-2 hours continously because after that game becomes some laggy.Leave the phone aside for some 10-15 minutes and than again you can play game.I think this is not a big problem because everyone is not progamer even not a gamer.Another best party i like about this phone is it's compactness.The phone display size is enough for multimedia consumption like playing music and videos.One hand usage is not provided in so many devices but galaxy m31 can be used one handed.Go for it!!

  Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) is an average low mid range product for a reasonable price. It is as fast as my Galaxy S7, but not as fast as S20. Please don't buy this phone expecting to be flagship Galaxy S20. You get what you pay for.

ALMOST PERFECT IN THIS PRICE RANGE.
",5,"

  In overall aspects the phone is 95% perfect( 100% perfect if you have no problem with slow charging).I have used a similar mobile REDMI NOTE 8 PRO. And I can tell that this 64MP camera is GREAT. The pictures are sharp and clear.Touch screen and display are AMAZING.Fingerprint sensor works perfectly.When I received the phone, it was 53% charged. I used it till 16% for 7.5hrs before putting it on charge. So the battery looks great. But,while writing this review, it's been 2 hrs since charging and it has still reached 80%. So it's charging slow, like really slow. Comparing it to Redmi note 8 pro, it's taking too much time to charge. It's not charging like a fast charger.On other aspects, it's 10/10 including battery life.The only issue is charging. I talked to Samsung, they told you can use a 25W charger if you need. So let's see.P.S- If you are looking for a good non-chinese phone, then this is it.( Or other phones of Samsung Galaxy M-series)Edit: After using for more than one day,the battery doesn't seem like a real 6000mAh. It's not lasting long like a 6000mAh battery. I'd say it's more like a good 4500mAh battery.

A good product needs to improve in some areas

  After 45 days usage of the devicePros:1. Long standing battery (6000 mAH).2. Super Amoled display which improves  camera,  picture and video quality where other companies are using  LCD display.3. Low SAR value, so radiation and mobile heating as low as possible.4. 15W fast charger takes around 2hrs to reach from 0 to100 percent, more than 15W charger may also increases heat problems.5. A South Korean product.Cons:1. Exynos 9611 processor is not that much effective like Snapdragon, so for normal usage and video playing no problem but hangs if play games in HD quality.2. Signal receiving capacity is weak.3. Volume difference from max volume to last but one max volume is more.4. Back cover is made up of plastic instead of  Gorilla glass, so build capacity need to improve including design.

  This phone is really good for mid range. I bought this phone 6 months back and using it ever since.ProsThe phone has a smooth UI and the AMOLED display complements itI am not photographer but occassionally takes photos. I tried the normal mode and the macro mode. The images are crisp and was able to capture minor details. Overall the camera quality is good.Nothing much to say about 6000mAh. I am able to get the battery backup for 1.5 to 2 day and one more best thing about this phone is Fast charger is provided along with the phone unlike most other brandsConsThe fingerprint sensor mismatch rate is slightly highPhone automatically restarts ( happened twice)After every update the bloatware apps ask to install some app I find this annoyingOverall this phone is good buy for the provided specs.

Worth buying for in this price range

  I have been using this phone since 3 months now, so I'll jot down everything that i experienced in these months.Pros:1. Not at all delicate, samsung has made sure that their product is made with excellent durable materials.2. Even after using several apps at same time it never showed any lag.3. Good battery backup with fast charging.4. Moderate heating only while charging.Cons:1. Camera doesn't come up to the expected hype that was created by youtubers.2. Finger print sensor doesn't work often when fingers are little bit wet/sweaty.3. Size of the phone is little big, not so easy to use in single hand..Overall I would reccomend this handset to everyone who is looking for a phone that performs your daily rough use tasks with average use of camera, games, binge watching.

  This product is awesome. Super budget friendly, super powerful mobile phone.Pros:-Battery life:Under normal use it lasts whole day.Memory:Ample amount of RAM, i.e., 6GBProcessor:It has a very powerful processor, its a 10nm design, and it powerful than any snapdragon processor at this price.Display:Obviously, when it comes to displays nobody does it better than Samsung.Camera:It's a 64 MP quad camera setup which is very impressive and new high efficiency format use less storage.Biometrics:Fingerprint sensor and face unlock features work quite fast.Cons:-Weight:It's a bit heavy but for 6000mAh battery this is obvious.Speaker:I've compadre Galaxy A50s and this phone's speakers side by side but A50s is better. M31 is cheaper so can't complain but they could have given better speakers.Doesn't support Samsung Secure folder.

Pros and cons of buying Samsung Galaxy M31
",5,"

  The most and amazing thing in this Samsung galaxy M31 is this has Great superior camera quality all modes have a great and unique features also the battery life is amazingly can last upto 2 days after playing 4 movies back to back listening music back 2back 8 hrs till now in this budget no phone can give this battery life.And the fingerprint reader sensor is great it works in fraction of second.However only one thing that is missing in this phone for which Samsung is most smart company that is BIXBY I missed a lot using this phone like my all others Samsung galaxy A51S A50 and s9+ has .if samsung would give an update in which Bixby will be included.Trust me I can buy this phone for my full family including all 18 members.

A must buy, Non Chinese company product in this price range
",4,"

  Giving this review after 4 days of use. I was the ios user but now I am realizing that spending too much on phones which people used to change in around two years is a waste of money. Hence shifted to Android (Galaxy M31).Firstly I was thinking about Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, but since it is a product of Chinese Company, so stooped there only. Too much Patriotism :).Pros-- The phone looks beautiful.- The display is awesome, played some 4k videos from youtube. Screen quality is really awesome. It also has Blue light filter functionality. You can schedule the same as per your need.- The overall performance is good. No heating. Played general games (NFS etc) and it worked really well- 6000 Mah battery is really big enough for me (comparing with iPhones). Lasts for almost 1.5 Days with general use.- 64 GB storage is sufficient and you can expand it to 512 GB with an external card.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone. The phone came with a 30% charge. Charged fast.- The camera is good. The macro camera works perfectly fine. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.Since I am not a photographer, this is more than enough for me.- Fingerprint and Face recognition is good (Don't want to compare with apple.)Cons -- The phone is a little heavy and not slim (But it doesn't look bulky, it really looks awesome)- There were some claims that it takes 160 minutes to charge from 0-100% which is wrong. This phone takes around 3.50 hours for full (0-100) recharge.- There is no earpiece provided by Samsung.Overall this Phone is really a must buy in this price range. Don't go with negative reviews.I have seen some reviews where people are saying the camera is not good. It is not justifiable to compare its camera with DSLR or any other high-end phones (For example iPhone 11) asYour DSLR can not make calls and much more other things what this phone canand Other high-end phones like iPhone 11 don't come in 16000 Rs.The camera quality is really good and you can go for it.

  After watching Neagtive reviews of this Mobile Phone on Youtube this phone amazed me with its capabilities the Dragon sized battery will easily move you to the second day after one time full charge RAM is sufficient for gaming use not a single lag observed after 3 week of purchase.Samsung managed the specs of 6000 mAH battery and 6 GB RAM and Best Quad Camera  with removing some specs like Rear glass back, Metal Body.Phone is too light weight in compare to my Iphone Xr******AND THIS IS MADE IN INDIA TOO******

Great phone in the Budget phone Segment minus the old Processor
",4,"

  I was looking for a budget phone with a decent battery and camera.Samsung M31 seemed to fit in that category perfectly.Pros1) A gigantic battery of 6000mah with a 15v quick charging option. Gives you so much relaxation when you are using multiple things through the day. Have sailed through a day without battery charging.2) The Live focus feature on the camera works pretty well for the price it is being offered.3) Great captures with minute detail capturing under ample light. I am yet to use it under low light.4) Pretty lightweight for a phone with such huge battery size5) Two Sim card slots plus a memory card slot over and above the 128 GB storage is a bonus6) A secretly hid Dolby Atmos feature which adds quite an impact on the sound when on bluetooth or earphoneCons1) A very outdated processor which doesn't do justice to the 6GB Ram being offered. The functioning is quite okay2) Need to really work on the Face Unlock technology. I had to stop using face unlock on the second day because I was tired of so many disapproval from my phone3) Once you disconnect the call there is a 2 second lag for the call screen to go away which gets pretty annoying.4) Lot of redundant apps being given with the phone and loads of unwanted samsung apps attached which doesn't add value to your functions.5) Plastic body with multiple hand prints if being used with a cover.Overall If you are looking for  a budget phone with amazing camera and battery this is your phone. But if you are too much into gaming configuration it is not going to entice you much.

Nice Phone at a great price
",5,"

  I'm reviewing this phone after 3 weeks of usage. The phone is good if you are using it for normal usage. The 6000 mah battery can give you more than 24+ hrs if you just listen to music, use social media, and click pictures. here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) Big Battery: can give 1+ days using medium usage and 30+ hours if it's very light usage2) Nice display: sAmoled display is great and its the best in this price range3) Daylight photography nice: the colors are very accurate.4) Nice sound: it has a single speaker but the sound quality is nice5) The UI i.e One  UI 2.0 is very clean and nice to use.Cons:1) Uses Exynos 9611 chipset which is not best when compare to snapdragon 712 or MediaTek G90t.2) Camera2api is limited you don't get level 3 support so no Gcam available3) The stock camera is nice for daylight photography the colors are nice but during the night the quality is very bad the night mode does not work as well as it is supposed to do. Samsung can improve this is the upcoming update if they want its just a software issue.4) The updates are very less in Samsung smartphones. The phone is having a February security Patch. This can also improve the security patch updates  can be frequent.5) One more con is the details in the photos are missing due to the aggressive noise cancellation algorithm used by Samsung./when you zoom into photographs the details are missing. But in 64mb mode the details are present but it can also be done in 16 MB photo also.6) The battery takes approx 3 hrs to charge in spite of fast charging which is only 15 watt i.e adaptive fast charging as it is called by Samsung. If you use are charger having more than 15 watts rating it will still only take 15 watts of power from that charger. Samsung must allow the usage of more than 15-watt charger via software update if possible because to charge such a big battery in less time at least 30-watt charging should be allowedConclusion: if you are not a gamer and use your phone just to listen to music, click pictures, and use Facebook, Instagram, etc then this is the phone for you. You get a Samsung brand phone for such a price point with sAmoled display 64 MB camera, nice audio. There are some issues related to camera which can be fixed via updates like full camera2api support, improved night mode, and so little camera improvements and the frequent security updates should be provided.Overall: 8.5/10Camera: 8/10Sound: 9/10Display: 10/10Performance: 9/10Battery: 10/10

  Not the best but good one from samsung at this price point. Comes with the brand value of samsung.Camera quality is above average.Sony sensor would have been good at this price.Samsung GW1 sensor is not the best but this can capture quite nice clicks. Would recommend to use the manual camera mode if u r comfortable with it. Battery and Super Amoled display is the highlight of this device. Processor is decent, for everyday use its good. High-end games will run smoothly with high graphics.Minor lags can be noticed after playing for long time as the device heats up little bit.

  The Best Ever Battery and Camera for limited budget..💥💥 Hope Samsung produces more new smartphones on this process with battery n camera .. The 1st Best Thing in Samsung M31 is  CHARGE almost lasts for 2 DAYS. The 2nd Best Thing is the yr MP Camera is very much better to capture the pictures with Live Focus, Pro Mode, Night Mode , Food Mode, Slow Mo, Super Slow Mo and Hyperlapse. As it is mentioned M31 is a Fast Charging mobile, it takes almost 3 hrs to charge 100%. It should have alleast charged 100% within half an hr to 45 mins. Charging Time is the only backlog for M31. Please Charge it during N8 hrs. If it is charged Once, It will Surely last for 1 and Half days for Sure for regular Mobile Users. It's best to buy this Mobile especially for Low Budget Users.

   This set is really great with a great camera & battery life . This phone doing  great under 10% battery life also. And what can I say about the 64mp camera , it's too much loveable  , with it's slow motion video & hyperlapse.  In 128gb 20gb takes stem memory at first  , and you can zip irregular use apps easily.  I used this since last 1month , without hanging a little bit this set is giving the best experience with open lots of tabs , & apps.About the phone's back it's a little scrathable , so please must use a back cover and a protective screen guard also.I'm a average user , so full 100%charged phone gets charge out in 2days with my using .Video experience,  camera experience is much better than gaming experience. I don't say it's not a gaming phone, but this phone not for a high level gamer .At overall view, this phone (galaxy M31 ) is a brilliant device with less worst reviews & a big deal in low price .Buy it, and use it , you must fall in love with it❤

just wow at this value

  Writing this review after 4 months of usage...Pros:1. Awesome Camera Quality...(you can see images on my Instagram page nature_diary2020). my favourite one is Macro Mode. Better than iPhone 8 which I was using previously, and One Plus 5...2. Battery life is just wow..with a full charge battery lasts up to 1 and a half day with high usage...3. Still, I haven't faced any lag or hanging issues...4. Screen resolution is good.Cons:1. The body is plastic which could have been better(metal).2. Charging time is approx 5 hours for 0 to 100% charging, I prefer charging overnight which matches its requirement. Charging cable is very small which I understood is required for charging 6000 mah battery faster.3. It feels heavy on your hand after holding one plus 5 it feels like you are holding a brick.4. There's no headphone provided with the phone.so you need to buy a headphone additionally.Conclusion: I am a tech-savvy person and I do travel a lot. this phone fits into all my requirements with great camera, good battery life and a lot more. After 4 months and a few days of usage, I haven't faced any issues with this phone apart from its charging time which is approx 5 hrs and keeps the juice up for one and half day.

Best phone for 16k (128gb)
",5,"

  The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.

  I have been using this phone since April and i can say that this phone is not meant for gamers at all, the camera quality is satisfying, better than most of the mid range devices, battery life is as good as it has been promised altough it takes a lot of time to charge its 15W charger takes at least 2.5 hrs to charge from 0 to 100 if not more, the processor is not that good, if you're playing a game(suppose PUBG mobile) the game lags, moreover there are some glitches that needs to be fixed for example sometimes the keyboard will freeze and not respond, It'd good if Samsung tries to fix that in near future.The cover also gets dirty easliy(dk why) finger print, smudges are visible on the back cover for the space black model.Overall Pros1. SAMOLED display2. Battery life3. CameraCons1. Processor2. Charging time(its irritating)3. Some glitches4. Sometimes it gets heated up on heavy use, though not much( talking abt the screen near the camera)I hope future buyers will find it helpful5. Speaker not that loud

Awesome battery life
",4,"

  A good product at an affordable price. Battery life is very good. With moderate use it lasts upto 48 hours.Camera is pretty good, descent shots even in low lighting, good depth, macro shots are good too.Screen resolution and display is impressive.Fingerprint sensor is fine, but it doesn't work properly if the fingertip doesn't fully cover the slot. If your hands are quite occupied it sometimes will be difficult  to unlock the phone.RAM is good, I have several apps running at the same time, but didn't  face any time delay while working with them.Good phone if you mostly browse, blog,  network socially and watch videos and movies.  But probably not for heavy gaming.A product worth  buying.

Monster battery, smooth working. A few negative points on camera
",5,"

  Perfect suited for businessmen and people who are always on the run. I am using this phone for about 20 days, battery life is awesome it lasts for about 3 days with normal usage(phone, whatsapp, fb, insta and netflix included). Camera quality is above average could have been better but at this price range more that what I expected. Macro lens does not have focus option and generally the images are blurry. Touch is good. A bit heavy but easy to use. Face unlock is better in comparison with other like brands.To sum up if you are looking for a phone to perform general task like call, videocall, whatsapp, long battery life go for this phone. If you are looking for a phone to solve your photography requirements then this will disappoint you.

My Experience with Samsung Galaxy M31
",1,"

  At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications and featuresThe spec sheet of the Galaxy M31 looks similar to that of the Galaxy M30s. It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection which should keep it from picking up scratches too easily. The display has good viewing angles and is legible when outdoors. There are two colour profiles to choose from, and you can also change the white balance.Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant for Rs. 15,999 or Rs. 16,999 respectively. However, Samsung is offering a Rs. 1,000 discount which brings the prices down to Rs. 14,999 and Rs. 15,999 respectively. The duration of this offer has not been specified.Samsung has bumped up RAM on the Galaxy M31 compared to its predecessor which should give it some leverage while multitasking. We did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD content.We ran our usual benchmarks on the Galaxy M31. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 191,981 points which are higher than the Galaxy M30s did. The Galaxy M31 also scored 348 and 1,247 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M31 managed 41fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 8.9fps in GFXBench Car Chase

Best midrange phone with packed features
",4,"

  After using over 6 monthsDislikes: the camera does not produces decent picture and degrading further.The battery now only stays for a day with normal usage so similar to other phones. Not seeing any big value with 6000mahEarlier review on first week of usage.Likes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.Dislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.Conclusion : The phone is just a basic handset and cannot be used for long time like 2 or 3 years. The back of phone needs cover from first day else you end up with scratches and discoloration. It's not a great handset as it claims.

  The GALAXY M31 has been in my consideration since its launch as it created buzz prelaunch due to its features. This product is being projected as the leader in this segment. Now come to the real and first experience, this phone has delivered upon its feature. The Camera quality is amazingly better than other phones who are selling themselves on camera feature. The picture quality with real colors, several modes of photography proves its claim about the camera quality. The video shooting is also better as compare to the ""Camera Phones.The second feature which is very outstanding,despite speculation, is Battery capacity, performance and life. The Battery runs long(upto 20 hours) while using internet,Netflix or whatever OTT. The battery life also enhances Gaming and phone experience. The best thing, battery of such big capacity doesn't make it hot while using full features. The accessibility and control are impeccably good. There is no lag while using or locking-unlocking. The fingerprint reader is also of higher quality. It performs way way better than other phones of this segment. Other features like screen resolution, touch also gives you more value for money. Overall this phone by Samsung in this price is a Big thumbs up, you'll have a good experience while using GALAXY M31.

But the fingerprint  scanner  is not so good it take little bit more time to unlock  the phone.

Without lagging &low heat up of phone only 20 to 25%battery reduce  after 2 to 2.5 hour of gameplay. Other functions are great but samsung doing so much price cut by not giving earphone or back cover with the phone. Talking about charging it don't  take so much time even with 6k MaH battery but yes the charger with m31s must be with this phone too. Sharing some picture clicked with my phone.....

Samsung M31 latest smartphone you must buy!!
",5,"

  Samsung recently introduced its latest smartphone in the M-series with the launch of Galaxy M31. The smartphone comes with a host of interesting features and it is priced at Rs 14,999 for 6GB RAM + 64GB storage and Rs 15,999 for 6GB RAM + 128GB storage variant.  The latest smartphone from Samsung is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. So, is it enough to compete against the likes of Poco X2 and Realme 6? Let’s find out. Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option. Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.  Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.  That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos. In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements. Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.  Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.  Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.  On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

  As per the price range its a fully loaded device...But the only thing thats a problem is the touch pad (finger print sensor)  works only sometimes. Most of the time touch doesnt work,  have to use other unlock options,  initially i thought its a bug needs to be clear on system updates. But same thing after updates.  Now m used to with alternatives in unloacking the phone...

  Writing this review after using this phone for more than a month as my primary device.Not less than a Flagship phone at a very comfortably affordable budget. Slim, light weight and attractive desgine. Premium to hold and use. The screen is amazing and produces amazing colours.Pros :1. First of all amazing 64 megapixel camera shoots amazing and highly detailed pictures with amazing colours.. ultra wide angle camera of 8 megapixel is too good for landscape and nature photography.5 Mp Macro-camera and 5 Mp depth camera adds a special touch to this quad canera device..Front facing 32 Mp camera captures the true skin colour in almost every situations.The most amazing feature is its night camera which captures images better or almost equal to some professional cameras.It also offers 4k video and slo-mo on both i.e. front and rear camera and ultra slo-mo on back camera.2. 6000 mah battery is more than enough and lasts almost around 26-27 hours approx (am not a gamer or a heavy user but ""always on display"" is continuously on.)3. Amazing sound, loud, crisp and clear. Clear voice on calls.4. No heating problem while on charge or on call or while surfing internet for longer hours.5. Nice on screen animation and colour reproduction.Cons :1. The thing which matters the most is there are not much options in the PRO MODE.2. The keyboard lags a little bit and takes around 2 minutes to resume back.3. If you turn on the speakers while on call, you won't be able to hear anything the other person is saying from the other side.4. When you creat folders on the app screen and add apps on it, the apps would come out every time you restart the phone.5. There could have been more features in the phone as compared to other brands in this price segment like locks and security, dual apps, IR Blasters etc etc.Overall am quite satisfied with this smartphone as i wanted a camera centric phone with a large battery and this is absolutely that device.

  This phone has Very good display. Sound quality is decent. Camera and Battery are excellent and in day to day life phone is very easy to use and doesn't feel heavy. Thanks to the Samsung UI all my with Android Q it's clean and simple. Speaker is not so loud. Fingure print reader is fast. I also played many games like asphalt 9 and did face any lagging issue because of 6 GB ram. Multitasking is very well handled. The body is little delicate so you need a protective case. Overall it's a good phone and also made in India.

  What a fabulous decvice....I was a little sceptical about purchasing this phone as i saw some bad reviews, but trust me those people i think don't know how to use phone properly...Pros..........The Mesmerizing display, it can easily beat the display of any phone in this price eg. Poco x2, redmi note 9 pro etc....The battery is just great, last for 1 and half days, and some people are saying charging time is more than 3 hrs, thats not true, it charges in roughly 2 to 2 and a half hour.One UI 2.0 is the most beautiful UI , you cannot even compare it with MiUI or any other ui, since its Ad free and just so easy to use.The camera is beast in this one with soooo many features. No complaints there.The processor is also really good, handles all day to day tasks plus games like pubg pretty easily, if you play pubg for 1 hour , it will drain only 10 to 12 % of battery............Cons..........Only thing i didn't really like is that its not a slim phone, if you get a case and toughened glass, it gets pretty thick.If you are okay with that like me...then don't think much just go for it. 😍

Great deal for this price range

  Purchased this Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) from amazon on 8h March 2020. After using 3 months here is my review.First impression: Value for Money. Great phone for the price range of 15k.Proc:1) M31 already use Android 10.0 as factory default operating system. This OS has been installed together with Samsung user interface ONE UI 2.2) four-camera at back side body with 64 MP f/1.8 for standard + 8 MP f/2.2 for ultrawide + 5 MP f/2.2 for Macro + 5 MP f/2.2 for DOF. The main camera with 64 megapixel and big aperture number will help us take better light at dark situations.3)  LCD screen resolutions use Super AMOLED for good color display. The screen resolutions also already have Full HD+ at 1080 x 2340 pixels.4) have big battery 6000 mAh. This is very important for anyone who want to use Android smartphone more then 2 days at standard activity.5) have big battery 6000 mAh. This is very important for anyone who want to use Android smartphone more then 2 days at standard activity.Cons1) Charging time, It will take nearly 3hrs to full charge2) Front camera does not have LED flight flash for selfie photo. This camera is located at top of LCD screen. But we can use LCD display brightness for light help.3) Not water resistance.

Budget Worthy

  I have wanted to buy this phone ever since I saw it would be launching. But I had to wait 2 months for several reasons before I got it.A piece of advice if you do buy it.. Please charge the phone completely before using it for the first time. It's really helpful. I've read many reviews here and everyone who found it faulty probably didn't charge it to 100% before first use (It does gets heated the first time. Don't worry about it.) Now to the review. Waiting two months eagerly for this... my expectations were as high as it could be and my phone did meet it to a great extent.Fingerprint reader is great though sometimes it does not recognize on the first try. But again for the budget it's pretty good.The display has to be the biggest pros of the phone. I was so obsessed with it I didn't even want to use a screenguard XD. It is very smooth and videos look great on it.The back of the phone also looks very attractive despite what I've read about it. It does get fingerprints all over it but nothing that can't be rid of.Face unlock I had to try just for the review and it is pretty good. (Keep in mind I tried it only for a few minutes, just a couple tries)Battery life is really good. I usually binge watch TV shows on my phone and it would last for a day and a half. When I tried gaming, I didn't find any freezing or lagging. But the battery does start reducing a little more quickly ( It would still last for the whole day) and sometimes heats up but nothing to be worried about.Coming to the camera, the default camera is 16MP and you'll have to change it to 64MP and you can't zoom in using 64MP. Also it takes up more space. But the camera quality is pretty awesome. However the video and every other mode are in 16MP. The front camera default is 16MP too I presume, and ultrawide front camera is 21MP and you can change it to 32MP. The front camera is great too. However I don't recommend the phone to hardcore photo enthusiasts considering it might not meet your expectations. But keeping the budget in mind I give it 5 stars. The video mode is good however the super steady mode is very grainy.(I'm not sure how exactly it works yet). And the super slo-mo video can only be used in daylight for best results. Photos in lowlight are not the best. But there is a flash option for front camera where the screen goes bright white during a shot and it compensates really well. I was happy with most of the camera features but it isn't the best being a photo enthusiast myself. It still does a great job nonetheless. The performance is amazing.Talking about storage the system takes up 16GB and other 4GB gets used up while setting up. You basically get 108GB give or take as your storage(For 128GB variant). It's been almost 11 days since I got the phone and it's done a great job of impressing me and my family. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a budget friendly smartphone. And to those trying to cut off Chinese products.Overall I have had a pretty awesome and exciting experience with it so a five star rating. Totally would recommend.Update: 3 months laterStill very good. Camera quality is really awesome now I've played with it enough. But battery life is not completely to the mark of 6000 mAh but it's still pretty great. Would recommend Samsung m31s now. But if you can't afford that this is the best choice for you.

Great Value For Money!
",5,"

  A great phone for the price. Here are the pros and cons:PROS:1. 6000mAh battery that easily lasts for more than a day.2. 6 GB RAM that makes switching between tasks very smooth and quick.3. Quad camera setup takes excellent pictures. (The photo of the box was taken on the M31.) The 32 megapixel front camera also takes great selfies.4. The super Amoled display is on par with all the flagship devices. Amazing viewing experience.5. Comes with latest Android 10.6. Although the processor isn't a flagship chipset, it can easily handle games like Asphalt 9, Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG, etc. at high graphics without any visible lag.7. Manufactured in India. During this time when boycott of Chinese goods is on the rise, this is the best alternative to any other Chinese branded phone on the market at the price range.Cons:1. Certain aspects of OneUI 2.0 are missing. Like edge lighting, secure folder, knox security, which are available on models like A51, which runs on the same chipset.Final review: Although certain aspects available on other samsung models are not on the phone, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, making this one of the best value for money smartphones. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a phone between ₹15,000 to ₹20,000.

Pretty Decent Phone

  It has been a month since I have been using this phone. To be honest, I was skeptical in going for a samsung phone after a bitter experience in 2010 with one of the earlier galaxy Y phone. However, I find this phone good enough in this price range if one wants to opt for non Chinese phone. I wanted a phone with 4k video recording capability and this phone has a pretty decent  camera. To my surprise, i find even the front camera is capable of 4k video. The battery lasts a day for heavy usage and for a normal usage, it would go almost a day and half. In terms of memory, this is a 6GB, 128GB model and therefore the best one can ask for in this price bracket.

  This is one amazing device for the budget. You get the best of Samsung in a budget! The display is amazing. It is comparable to Note 10 Lite! I checked that by myself. The USP must be the quad camera setup with 64 megapixel being the main camera. I also like the stabilization in video recording even in wide angle lense. This is great features for vloggers. And cherry on top is the massive battery. This is probably the best mid range offering from Samsung till date.

  This is really a beast phone. 6I MAH Battery 64 MP camera and exynos 9611 processor with gaming booster. It has got everything which a user need to have under 20k. Much better than other Chinese phones and the built quality if amazing. One can never feel that this phone Carries a 6k MAH battery. Picture quality is amazing and the super Amoled screen is just icing on the cake viz super smooth and crisp and responsive mind it you are just paying 17 or 18k for a samsung product with these specs.Gaming:I don't find any issues with this phone as far as gaming is concerned. I play pubg with mo lag at all at smooth ultra resolution. Yes, HDR ultra or HD Extreme is a bit laggy after sometime (30 min ) but you can play with HD extreme with issues and will be so much fun.It is worth buying for someone who is looking for a feature packed phone with Korean tech and an alternate for chinese viz useless to spend upon as most of the chinese creates problem as soon as your warranty is over.

  After so much of research, I decided to go with M31 on the second day of launch. To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.Pros:1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.3. Display is too good4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use5. Voice clarity and signal is good6. Looks very good and stylish too.Cons:1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.3. Charging cable length is very short4. No earphones provided with this mobile.5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat alsoOverall is a Good budget phone to buy.

So if you are looking for phone of range 15-20k i would recommend to buy this rather than other chinese phones.I bought this by exchanging my old phone the delivery was fast and everything was packed up and done easily.Remember they don't send backcover with this order it separetely.

The camera works just fine and tbh sometimes it even gives you the shot just like dslr..Battery, damn once your phone learns the way you use your batter it will give you 23hr screen on time which is op.I am a pubg player with graphics hdr+high+shadows enabled+colorful and it only comsumes 10 percent in 1 hour which is 😍It is a mega monster battery.It would have been more better if they woukd provide a mobile cover, headphones and a more fast charging adapter.But there is one disadvantage and that is the chipset.It sucks.Overall its a good phone.

According to front camera it's good for those who like beauty effect on Oppo, Vivo mobile can say it's awesome; beauty & White skin to posing on social media.

  I have been a loyal Oneplus user since 5 years now. Had been using Oneplus One for 5 years since it's launch and wanted to buy the soon to be available Oneplus Nord.But Samsung clearly pulled me back to its family which I had left after buying the Oneplus One. Had been using Samsung Note 1 for 3 years before that.Lovely to see Signature Features like Swipe to Call or Palm Swipe for Screenshot still in place. Makes the whole affair a lot smootherProcessor speed is amazing. The screen is beautiful.Google Assistant Flawless than ever before. Really handy weight.Camera being at its best.Battery being the Topper of the chart.All in all being in a dillema between the OnePlus Nord and this phone, I guess at 12000 bucks Cheaper the M31, compared to the other players in the range is a Strategic Winner.Use the save 12 grands to invest in a good Bluetooth Ear Pods.Happy to have spent money on this. A very safe bet to take.

  I loved the super amoled display of this device, Samsung's super amoled displays are the best. Finger print scanner is decent. I didn't liked the face unlock, it is slow and sometimes don't even detect my face. I didn't liked one thing that we have to reset our phone to factory version if we want to change the PIN given at the time of setup. Camera is really good when lighting is properly and in low light is OK. I liked the variant of 6GB RAM 64GB ROM cause it has 512GB of expandable storage so can buy a memory card if required or can just go for 6GB RAM 128GB ROM storage cause it requires only ₹1,000 more. Processor is decent but Samsung should have improved it. Colour variety is not here only two colours BLACK and BLUE which also gets easy fingerprints on it so I recommend to get one phone case. I didn't liked that they didn't gave a earphone in the box. Battery is massive 6000mAh with 15 Watt charge is really good. It's price is now ₹16,500 base variant and ₹17,500 higher variant due to pandemic. Audio quality is OK. It's resolution is FHD+(1080p).

  Finger print: Since most of the samsung devices uses secured loop based finger sensor which is very accurate and much faster when compared to other devices especially iconic mobiles . The rear-mounted exact location is always reachable and which adds advantage for user experience.Battery life : Generally, there is no need of back-up charge when it comes to samsung devices. But, M31's 6000mAh gives us more confidence about as Samsung maintains it standards and especially this device surveys more than expected hours in bad play also. And with the emergency battery saver of this device hold better place.Camera- Quality: Most impressive part in M31 is it's stunning 64MP Quad camera. The flexibility which gives to the user is tremendous. To capture the love of my life, Sensorical sensitivity in which used to add more nature beauty and most best part of day-to-day life.Thanks for the genius product and brilliant attentive in this technology world

  At the first look, Samsung M31 looked very beautiful  to me. I bought the ocean blue, 6 GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage variant. The camera module at the back looks very professional. I have been using this phone over a month now and I am impressed with the performance. It serves all my needs very well. I had done bit of gaming as well and I could say I'm satisfied with the performance. The best thing is it's UI, I felt super comfortable with it and it was like it learns my usage pattern. The phone feels smooth while working even on heavy usage. The best part of it, for which M31 has all the hype, the battery back up is really very good.

However it is not serving justice to  boasted monster battery capacity.- Camera quality is very good when the  lighting is good otherwise average- Takes at least 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs to charge 100% using fast charge and minimum 4 hrs using normal charging option.

  My Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in ocean blue color.The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to when I fell asleep playing on the mobile and using it and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. No doubt, great battery life!The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything.The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Decent camera quality!Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaints with anything about this mobile and 128GB of internal storage, I did not even consider using the microSD slot since 128GB is more than enough for me.

  I ordered this phone within few hours of launch, and was promptly delivered the very next day. Thanks to Amazon for on time deliveryI bought the ocean blue, 128 GB variant which is kind of dark blue and I really love the colour. I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.The set up  took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH BatteryOverall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it

The charging speed is more like 1% per minute (on avg)its soooooooo good  Trust me you wont regret after buying it.The super amoled screen enriches the display,the pictures what you see in your screen looks much better in this phoneNow the drawbacks it's somewhat bulky and the packaging is bad they didnt even bubble wrap it and that's all the drawbacksPics in order: front,back,normal cam×2,wide angle,2x macroIts much much better than A50

  This phone for its price is best in class. While Chinese phones may pack more features but Samsung is clearly a class apart.It has the best fingerprint reader which is blazing fast.The camera is excellent at the price point and the AR feature is a new addition that is quite fun.The battery life is awesome. With a 6000 mAh battery it will always last a full day and then some more.It charges quickly even though it has a large battery thanks to the included fast charger.The screen is the best at the given price point with crisp and vivid images.The phone is snappy with zero lag. It runs smoothly.The fact that it can support dual Sims and an SD Card without any glitches and the fact that you don't have to decide between having two sim cards or one sim and an SD card is excellent.The gesture controls are handy and call quality is excellent.All in all this is completely worth the money. At this price point you simply can't get a better phone

Camera quality is amazing with 64MP camera. It can help u read small words from a distance of 10m. Wide angle and macro shots are amazing. This phone is perfect in all fields in a very small price. Love u samsung for such nice product. Hope such new amazing products like this.

Buy it, you are on right page.

  Overall this is great piece to buy. How let us analyse.Battery life.Once fully charged it can stand upto 7 days if you don't use it except for calls for about an hour daily. In other terms 5 days when you yse it for calls about 7 hours daily.Yet another terms, 3 days, when you watch movies, play songs, for about 7 hours daily.CameraNo words, it is simply amazing. I have not seen  such camera in any phone till now. Apart from camera there are many many features too, such as ARDoodle, which is awesome!The few things which i can say are lacking are:1. fingerprint, it sometimes (1 out of 15) doesnot work.2. Calls, Speaker for calls has a little less sound as compared to Nokia or Xiaomi phones.But Since I have purchase many other phones of this price range, this beats them all.Buy this without doubt.

It's a Monster!

  It's the best mid ranger phone. It's has everything what a person needs. Big battery which is its wow feature, it helps me to not to charge  a phone for 2 days. Camera has it's top notch quality. The front notch has pleasant design and it is waterproof, as I have tested. Fingerprint reader is very  much fast as compared to other phones. It's  sleek and lightweight  as it's  have 6000 MAH battery but it doesn't feel bulky. I prefer you to buy this without comparing because it's the best monster.

  I am writing this review after 2 months 😁yeah and it's very good I didn't get any scratches on the screen only one because of my nails , am not using any glasses and back cover since I purchased only the problem is with back I have many scratches on polycarbonate back , it has a great camera, sound and battery 😛 , though the battery charge is slow but no problem with that you can turn off fast charging from battery settings and plugin at night . You can turn on if you want . Overall good experience with this SAMSUNG M31 mobile .

Best phone to buy if you are looking for daily usage purposes like movies and awesome camera setup.
",5,"

  M31 is for those who just want a phone which would click decent pictures, have a good battery life, and are not planning for heavy gaming.Coming to the camera quality, 64 MP camera, it clicks pictures beyond your expectation. The colours seem natural and when you zoom into the pictures you can feel 64 MP.The only disappointing thing about camera is that Night modes get distorted a lot of times. And even the macro camera didn't perform that good.Fingerprint sensor is fast but I have faced few issues where it would not respond unless I awake the screen by clicking power button.Battery life is which stands out in features as it says 6000 mAH. But I am very disappointed about it as after using for almost a week. Even though 6000 mAH, it just feels like I am using a 3500 mAH battery phone. I feel it is the problem with Exynos 9611 processor as it is not optimized. But still you can use the phone for one whole day with playing few games and movies. But with normal usage you can go up to 1 and half day.But the best feature is that you get sAMOLED display for this price. The colours are awesome. And with widevine L1 certificate you can stream FHD on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

Very Good Phone except for high end gaming
",5,"

  I have been using this phone for more than a week. I was very confused to buy this after people giving it bad reviews for camera, but i must say that the phone's best feature is its battery and camera. The battery works for 2 days easily with 3-4 hrs of gaming in a day, and the camera also takes beautiful pictures (although i think my Realme phone had a better camera). You get 6GB Ram, but i have experienced little lag while playing PES, PUBG is fine doesn't lag at all. Phone also doesn't get much heated up while playing games. I am very happy with the phone overall, except for high end gaming.

  The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.

  This phone from Samsung is worth for money it has stunning camera quality and the pics taken by this mobile is like a DSLR photograph it has very good battery but if u play games like PUBG mobile for too long then the battery life may reduce and it's finger print sensor is so good so far there is no issues.in simple words Samsung galaxy M31 is worth for money mobile phone if ur a mobile photographer this is the best and cheap option and for gaming it's okay but can't play for so long like 3 or 4 hours that's the reason I gave 4stars for the battery Life.For normal usage and photography this battery life is good.i prefer this mobile to people who r interested in photography and recording videos and normal gaming

  Samsung M31 is a very good phone to buy with highest configuration assembled that we can get at this price.It gives a great feel when using it, with super AMOLED display with 6 GB RAM , ample storage, 64MP Camera and long battery life,it gives you maximum than a other budget phones.Pros:1. Long battery life2. Great Camera (Front and Back) also has wide angle lenses for both front and rear cameras.3. Smooth Touch Screen Display4. Perfect Fit in Hand5. Fingerprint sensor works good6. OS works really smooth7. UI is greatCons:1. The fast charger provided is only a 2A charger which is less against the battery size, should be on the higher side, takes 2 to 3 hours to get fully charged.2.  The placement of the fingerprint sensor should have been a bit lower than it is currently placed. Finger reach is difficult.3. Certain inbuilt apps gets hanged and crashed if they are not updated timely. Also, their update can only happen through galaxy store app. Google Play Store does not respond sometimes.4. Gets heated up while charging and also when used for a long duration.

Best phone under 18k
",5,"

   This Samsung galaxy m31 is surely the best in the 18k category. It offers you a best in class super smiles display and the 64mp quad camera setup is also a true beast. The exynos 9611 is a good processor for day to day usage and is able able to support games such as pubg and fortnite but is not a fully gaming processor at all. This can be the best phone for you if you want a phone for consuming online content on Netflix and amazon prime.If you want the best camera hen also go for it.  Added to this is Samsung brand value and the service is also very good. The only concern with this phone is that it’s back panel is polycarbonate and there is no design effect on it. The face unlock is also a bit slow but it might be cured through further software updates.  At last I would like to say surely go for it👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

  Huge battery capacity even you are a heavy consumer of youtube video, you don't need to charge more than once in a day. Stunning picture quality of it's 64 MP camera. After july update flash is also working with 64 MP image processing battery consumption also improved. Actually it's camera is main usp of this samsung m 31. You can also record 4k video using this device Also mindblowing picture quality of 6.4"" samoled display it's key strength. 1080 p video resolution supported by this device. Attractive back panel but you should use a transparent backcover otherwise possibility of scratches increased with time. For better battery life remove backcover at the time of charging. I am not a pubg gammer but I played sniper 3d game, candy crush in this device but I never face any heating issue. It's ram management is also fine, I always use live theme but I didn't face any problem with that. 5 GHz. Wify supported by this device. Personally I just love my Samsung m31.

An excellent product in this range

  I bought this product as soon as the sale started and have been using it since then. The quality of the audio on this phone is great. I found this phone a really great product for someone who wants a good phone in nominal rate. Since then I have recommended this phone to many of my friends and relatives. All the features shown in the ads and written above are correct. The two variants available in ocean blue and space black offer a stylish choice for both girls and boys. Like all other Samsung devices, this phone also comes with a great display. The fingerprint reader works efficiently and the face lock feature is also very fast. I have bought the 128 gb variant so it comes with a lot of memory to store your photos and videos. The best thing about the product that I felt was its camera. If you want a good camera phone at an affordable rate, it is the best. It is literally a mega monster. The battery life is excellent. You can use your phone for 24 hours a day and play games and watch movies without any worries. The charger given along with it charges the phone in a very short time.

  I own an 8GB, 128GB Samsung M31 since June 2020. In my experience with the device for the past 2 and 1/2 months,  I found the following.Pros:  1. Awesome battery life.  2. Good camera quality under proper light. I clicked many photos which many commented as feeling like taken with a good DSLR.  3. Good processor.Cons:  1. Though the quality of the camera is good, in doesn't take good pictures in dim lights. The micro camera too is not as good as I expected.  2. Sometimes the device takes a few seconds to respond (I experienced it a few times).  3. Also sometimes the fingerprint sensor shows a delay.  4. While using internet the phone gets heated soon.  Over all I felt it a very good  mobile phone worth money. It does all my works properly.

  Monster battery - I thought this would be just a dream but it became true through this magestic phone! Once fully charged it has the power to withstand two days. I'm not joking 'cause this is SAMSUNG!Performance - 6gb is of course not a joke. If you are a gamer then m31 won't disappoint you. My old phone always overheats  when I play PUBG and all. You can smoothly and efficiently run PUBG, COD, & Other big games with no worries!Camera - If you are looking for picture perfect shots then this is one of the best in business. Quad 64 mp is just enough. And to be honest with you I was blown away by the in built stabilizer. Yes now I can take videos without any shakes!I would highly recommended this phone for daily use.

  This is a great phone by Samsung in terms of being  a mid range it gives fantastic performance in daily life but it lacks the camera quality that Samsung should have delivered, the camera is unbelievably dissatisfying because the pictures are always smudgy and not upto the rank of its competitors but its processor makes up for it, the performance  of this device is sublime and the battery last long enough to satisfy my needs, the fingerprint is fast but is not fast enough but thats okay, this is a good  phone for daily usage but if you are looking  for a hardcore gaming device  then this device is not enough to satisfy the needs required, and another  issue is not regarding the phone but the shipment, the order came to my doorstep  and cancelled  due to some packaging issue which was a disappointing thing because I had to order again to receive the same device, overall a good midrange phone, not the best but its okay

It takes 3 hrs to get full charge.3. Look wise also not that better.Overall nice experience using it. It is very good for daily use. It hangs if u play heavy games. I recommend A series if you are a Samsung fan. A series is better than this in all aspects (display, security and other features) except battery.

  Best branded mobile u can get under 20k. M31 is best at spec,  it can compete even with A31 and A51 mobile. Fingerprint is very smooth and ultra fast. Primary camera at 64MP mode gives mind blowing images. Front camera is also best with some added filters and effects. The best thing about M31 is the battery, lasting for about 2 days with normal usage and some gaming. Charging takes around 2.5 hrs which is the only fact that is bitter in this mobile. Screen seems to be very impressive with Amoled display. It is also gives me great company in games with very great performance. Pubg games seems to work smooth while your graphics is set to ultra. Body back side is built with plastic but it is not that worst. Exynos 9611 is working fine for now. Overall it can be rated 8.5 out of 10

I charged it next day to 100% to check how long it works...With 100% battery... I could use it for 2 complete days.That is just INSANE.Thanks Samsung for this amazing M31 SUPER SMART MONSTER PHONE.

  The phone itself is pretty robust, dropped it already but it's fine except for a dent or two on the Gorilla Glass back panel. Would still recommend using a cover, no screen guard needed though.The battery is, as expected, enough even if you're using it all day with continuous WiFi and Bluetooth connections playing videos or games.Great screen with a bright display and high sensitivity (can be adjusted in the settings).Fingerprint sensor in the back is also responsive and blends into the back well.The cameras are also good, have tried all the features yet and have found no complains.The performance for daily application is more than adequate, I can keep a taxing game open and use Spotify in the background with some chrome tabs plus texting too.

best mid range phone

  I bought this phone ( 6,128 Gb) for my mother on exchange. It was delivered on time and process of exchange of old phone was also very smooth.Talking about phone, this is the best mid range phone from samsung. Excellent battery life, awesome camera and most important zero lag which is the common problem with samsung earlier devices. With 6000 mAh battery, it can go 1 day without charge. The super amoled display is extraordinary. I am using oneplus 6t but while using m31 i personally felt that there is more crisp in display in m31 as compared to oneplus 6t .Talking about gaming, though i installed Pubg for once played for 2 days , guyz there is zero lag in it. Its really smooth.This mid range phone is best in terms of battery, camera, gaming, performance and most important its not chinese. If your budget is under 20k, go for it without giving any thought.Samsung is reliable one.

  Iam verry glad to use my new samsung m31 smart phone.  It comes with a stunning design which i have never seen in other brands. The main reason for selecting this one is  its mind blowing design. It has a 64 mp quard cam and 32 mp in front. Me and my friends were having fun by taking high resolution vedios and cristel clear photos. The battery is 6000 mah and having 2days backup which is very comfortable for my travels.  Back then i was using a power bank.  Now no need to use it. Literally i miss it 😃. Im still mesmerized by  using the phone because of it's 6.4 inch display.  Im fell in love with its notch. Samsung exynos 9 octa 9611 processor and the 6 gb ram keeps the phone energetic every time and also keeps me happy because im a game addict. I have used more than 11 phones in my life, but nothing gave me comfort like this one. If anybody there who  is planning to buy a budget phone, im suggesting samsung m31.

  You will forget to purchase Chinese Brand phones as all of them false configuration phones. Samsung Products are always Best in cell phones, previously I was using Red Mi since last 4 years now I switched to superior brand Samsung. M series is excellent. I am writing this review after 1 Month use of this phone.There is lots of reasons to buy this smart phone but I want to say only 2 main reasons.No 1 is Battery Back up : it comes with 6000 Mah battery which gives almost 2 and half days back up for genuine use. So I am charging my phone only twice a week.No 2 is Memory : Huge 128 GB Internal Memory & 8 GB RAMoverall Review : 64 MP Quad camera is giving excellent detailing of all the pics, SUPER AMOLED screen, there is almost all sensors in it.

  If looking for a phone in budget range of 16 to 20 thousand just blindly go for it. I have been using it since a month and I haven't found a single problem in it. From battery to camera and from display to design it's top Class.1-For design I would give 4.5/5 as samsung should improve in its polycarbonate back as its a fingerprint and scratch magnet2-For camera I would give it 5/5 as I can't describe its camera as it's super amazing.3-For display I would give it 5/5 the super amoled display is just stunning.4-For battery I would give it 5/5 as the 6000 mah battery lasts for 1 and half day as per my heavy usage.And this phone is also amazing for gamers looking for a phone under 20 thousand budget. And at last and once again go for it blindly

Excellent under 20000 INR.

  The device is the final best mid range best smartphone. The best thing about the device(after using it for a month) is its Mega battery of 6000 mah. I personally liked it and its charger which seems to be of 15 watts actually charges this phone really good.Talking about the camera, I enjoyed all around a dozen of camera modes. 64 MP camera is working great and the thing more enjoyable is the selfie camera and the night mode selfie. I would say that the night mode selfie is better than other selfie cameras with selfie flash.The phone, although not present with a Snapdragon chipset, works like one, if not better. The phone works good. I can type easily type at a rate of 3-5 words every second. There hasn't been any issues with the mobile related to anything. If you are looking for a phone cheaper than 20000 INR, this phone is for every Indian(Yes, it's made in India)!

M31 is good phone in medium budget
",5,"

  The Samsung Galaxy M31  is a good budge phone, after using one month, it can be concluded that the camera quality is wonderful, but a bit feeble in dark.  it is very lightweight even after containing the 6000mAH battery. The keypad of the phone is sometimes erratic might be due to network speed or some other reason.  Of course, charging is very fast but the phone gets heated, moreover, it also heated when you run camera and youtube for a long time. However, this problem is widely discussed on the Samsung community page it may due to the Exonys processor, that means a  bit hanging probleam.But the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good choice under INR 20,000. It offers some wide specifications such as a quality camera on both ends and a 6000mAh battery with fast charging support. In terms of performance, wise good but manufacturers must be considered the heating and the hanging problem of this smartphone.

True to how the phone was heralded. This phones is a monster when it comes to Battery and Camera
",5,"

  I have been using this phone for over 2 months now. The major reason why I went for this model was its battery. After putting the phone to mild-high usage everyday (amdist the lockdown), the battery safely lasted just over a day (~26-28 hours). I use many services concurrently - Bluetooth, Data, GPS, Hotspot. So the battery drain in my device would be faster. In any normal use pattern, this battery can easily last a day and half. As far as charging is concerned, there are a lot of discussions online regarding the charging time for this model, as the charger comes with a 15W power capacity. From my experience, I would say, it charges fast untill it reaches a certain threshold afterwhich the charging becomes slow. So, you can expect your phone to buff up to around 40% battery in next to no time, but if you would like to completely charge the device, then leaving it plugged in as you sleep might be your best optionAnother great thing about Samsung M31 is its Camera. The front camera has 32MP and takes very beautiful selfies. In the Live Focus mode, you can blur off the background and obtain a high aperture-esque effect in your photos. The Macro mode is also very powerful and would be suited for subjects with high detail per unit area - an insect, a flower, a fruit etc. As a consequence, you will have to go up close to the subject to really appreciate the power of the Macro mode. This is made slightly difficult as the camera doesnt auto focus in the macro mode. But with Macro mode, you almost never get auto focus anyways. The main 64 MP camera is also quite sharp. Sometimes, you may be tempted to use the 64MP over the Macro Mode because of the quality the 64 MP camera packs in. I have not been able to step out and click landscape pictures using the 64 MP back camera, but if household images are to stand any testimony, this 64 MP beast must rival a mid range DSLR easily. If you download Lightroom from the App store (which is a free app by Adobe), you can get going with your new hobby and have some good impressionable snaps to show off. If you get used to these three camera modes, the other modes becomes largely redundant. Food mode and Night mode are probably helpful (Especially in low light)Only point where Samsung could have done better is the finishing of the product. The images put up on the website flatters the actual product. The back cover is a poly carbonate finger print magnet. It would be worth your money to invest in a back cover (As the package doesnt come with one included in it). Samsung has a lot of preloaded apps but you can uninstall most and for the ones which you cannot uninstall, you always have the option to mute notifications. The processor is a new chip and would obviously pale in comparison against the Qualcomms and Realteks, but with 15k you can only expect so much. I do not play large graphic intensive games on my device, so would not be able to tell the performance in those situations. But the phone holds itself in modest esteem when I tried Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Plants Vs Zombies etc. Smooth and no problems. Media playback has also been satisfactory and the large screen really does help the resolution. Bear in mind, that for some videos on Youtube/Netflix/Prime, you wont be able to go the entire length of the screen. If you drag and stretch the video, you might fill the screen, but loose out on some details along the edges.All in all, this megamonster does all it promises and would really qualify as a great Value for Money option. If Battery and Camera is your thing, go for this product with your eyes closed!

Crisp AMOLED display Excellent battery life Decent performance Good photo quality in daylight
",5,"

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top. The display offers wide viewing angles and the larger screen makes watching movies and playing games a delight. The display comes with the usual Blue light filter which reduces the strain on eyes by limited the amount of Blue light emission. There is also a dark mode that will transform the entire phone in a dark colour. You can either enable the dark mode manually by going to the settings menu or can schedule it to get activated automatically. There is also an option called ‘Accidental touch protection’ which can prevent accidental touches to the display. Apart from this, the device also comes with an always-on display which shows the time, date and pending notifications. The smartphone offers a good display despite being a budget smartphone.

Premium choice in budget range.
",5,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31 is the decent choice available in budget range. It has a huge 6000 mAH battery which is its specialty along with Exynos 9611 octa-core processor and 6.4 inch super AMOLED display which is best in its class. Furthermore, It also has a fingerprint sensor on its back. Moreover, Cameras also are a key point in this smartphone with the primary of 64MP shooter along with 8 MP wide-angle lens, a 5 MP dept-camera and 5 MP for Macro shot. The front camera is 32 MP lens which can shoot even 4K videos. It also supports 15W fast charging and Dolby Atmos for premium sound experience. In shot as Samsung says"" Mega Monster"".

  This phone (Samsung Galaxy m31)is awesome. It is a plastic  design. I liked the UI Of samsung than mini.Since now I never experienced  any delays in the functioning of device.I am no expert in photography but photos  taken in this device  is just awesome.Telling about  battery. Battery  drains  very slowly. I used the phone continuously for 10 hours and the battery  reached  only 40% which  is unbelievable. Fingerprint sensor sometimes  makes some delay.But mostly it will detect the fingerprint within a fraction of a second. Overall this phone is worthy of the money you are spending.

  I brought this phone for me and I am using this device since last 2 month. In this range this is a best flagship smartphone and has almost in this phone what we need in the smartphone samsung known in his great display we know that samsung mobile is famous for his display making . So it has super amoled display was superb and great camera quality with 64MP and 32 front facing camera . And I never found any heating issue and hanging problem what we everyone had faced with samsung.Everything is great in this flagship smartphone but I’m only disappointed with charger although it has 6000mah battery but it contained only 15 watt charger if it would have 30 watt charger then this would be a great smartphone in this range because generally it takes 2.5 to 3 hour to fully charge this phone.Quite decent phone for gamers and if you really looking for brand like samsung blindly go for it.

  Has been a Redmi user for long but switching to Samsung is one of the best decisions i ever made.Pros- Extraordinary Camera-I wanted to take a handicam as I am a Teacher and wanted to record videos for students but i suppose i don't need to spend on anything else.2. Zero heating- Redmi's heating issues bought me here and i suppose i made a great choice.3. Processor- I have downloaded high intensity games like asphalt, Pubg to kill Lockdown boredom and i see absolutely no lagging and heating.Ps- I multi-task like hell yet its great😊4. Battery life is love. A proper Full charge lasts above one and half day😊👍Cons- Initially felt It charged a bit slowly but then realised its done to save its battery from damage and i feel fine.

Unbiased  review  : it's ideal ""phone"" but not the best one
",5,"

  So I've been using this phone for a few days now n I will try my best to give an unbiased review of the device ... Let's start with design : its pretty average looking , comparable to low end phones , but it dosen't matters as it's done to reduce cost , but even my mom's  Redmi 8a looks n feels better  , (it's just 7k) , the rear mounted fingerprint sensor is fast but requires your finger to be dry , wet fingers won't open it , its accurate too n can store 3 prints  at maxDisplay : big kudos to Samsung,  you know a display is good when it has samsung branding , its super amoled display  is vibrant , packs punchy colours  n night mode is sook good so much better than poco x2 , easily best display in this range , even compatible to flagship displays of 60 hzBattery : here it's kinda disappointing  , the the sAmoled  screen sucks up battery faster than you think n it works like a 5300 mah phone , but in medium  battery saving mode it works like a 6000 mah phone , so I'd recommend  using that all day , still a good battery nonetheless  never managed to get it lower than 30% . Charging time maybe long I.e 2hrs n 30_40 min but it's fair imo , I'd  really  charging it every day from 7PM to 10 PM then using it all throughout , till this hour again , tip : phones with fast charging shouldn't be charged  overnight , n yep it lasts all dayPerformance : decent , exynos 9611 is decent in performance  , paired with the one ui , its lag free and won't disappoint you , but its smooth , not fast , can't run pubg on 60 fps despite having those settings max to max can go to 45 and sustain on 30+ fps , so run games on medium settings and it's fine,  medium n light games run qite well , it's in the range of snapdragon 675 to sd 712 go with poco x2 if pubg is your 1st prioritySpeaking of the ui : one ui will not disappoint  you , dark mode is the best in this range  , has a tones of customization  options and its overall a good ui with zero ads , take  that miui  , blotwates are a lot but you can uninstall  them all , just mute the my galaxy app , it sents some annoying notifications  sometimes , easily the best ui next to Asus  zen uiHeating issue: yes the battery heats up while charging but it's nothing to worry about , it happens sometimes but it won't heat up that much playing light games , n has mild heating playing pubg on HDR+ultra  , also heats up while using camera  initially  but not now,  after using it a few times  .Speaking of camera  : camera is overall  above average , I liked the photos very well will give 2 samples too , it's good macro camera is decent  , 64 mp shots are large and not really that different from its regular shots,  but low light performance  is bad and without flash its worstOverall it's good  , go with vivo if you need camerasOverall verdict : if you need to upgrade  from some OLd Samsung  phone or just a upgrade n pubg / cod or gaming is not your first priority  then go for it !You're  also getting a tier 1 brand so servicing  is easyYou will love it if you like consuming content like videosFor gaming,  go for poco x2vSmall cons ( first world problems 😆🤭) :No Knox security , its given in all a series phonesSlightly less features than ui of a series phonesSlow face unlockCan't  use flash n EIS togetherMacro camera has no autofocus shittier  than poco x2's macro cameraNo feature to display daily  internet uses n internet speed which is present in miui 🤮😂And finally: Samsung's classical mistake : nothing in the box .... but a charger that too 15 watt , the phone should support at least 18 w but  it only supports 15₩ 🙄Gorilla glass 3 not 5!😔

  The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with an Exynos 9611 SoC and gets 6GB of RAM. It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. I think so this is the best phone realeased by the samsung upto the date under 20000rupees which serves with monster camera means quad camera of 64mp and 38mp front and back respectively.last bur not the least it has monster battery and the fast fingerprint reader and facereader.you can even create your emojis in it.

  I have been using this phone for the last 2 months and I am very satisfied with the performance till now.Pros1) Good Camera. Crisp picture quality.

Those who do not load huge games, this memory is huge.4) Quite a big screen. Aspect ratio is such that it is comfortable to hold.5) Super Amoled display given crisp picture on the screen.6) Though it has a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is not very heavy.Cons1) Though the fingerprint reader is far better than than earlier Samsung phones, it still needs to improve. The location of the fingerprint reader at the back of the phone is a little cumbersome to operate. On-screen fingerprint reader would have been preferred.If you are looking for a decent good phone within this budget, go ahead and buy it. It is absolutely the best buy at this price.👍👍👍

BEST BUDGET SMARTPHONE for a medium level user.

  I guess this phone can be considered as one of the best from Samsung so far in the mid range market. They have really put in some effort into and it shows. The phone runs smooth as heck so yeah the processor isn't that much of a problem. Since I'm not a heavy gamer so I can't really comment on the gaming aspect. But the camera is as good as a phone from this price range and with a Samsung tag can be which is interestingly very good. Battery life is extremely good. Love it. The fingerprint scanner works perfectly fine too. And then the basic Samsung features that you get are always good.All in all I would say that this is the BEST BUDGET SMARTPHONE so far from Samsung.

Amazing phone with #MEGAMONSTER battery
",5,"

  Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.

Samsung M31 after 1 month of usage.
",1,"

  I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.Pros:Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.

I hoped that during freedom sale the price would fall but it's same 17.5k.This phone is famous because of these three features.Great battery- I used this phone for 5 days without charging it, also I don't have any simcard on the phone.Camera is excellentSuper amoled display is good.I miss 3 finger screenshot that were on redmi.Also I don't like it's palm screenshot but I like its multiple page screenshot.I also miss seeing data speed.Lastly i can say it's processor is far better than my redmi note 4.Overall 4 stars because I miss taking easy screenshot( i'm a student) and miss seeing data speed. I know these features are not hardware related but one can easily give it for convenience as it's software related.

Overall a Fantastic device with brilliant specs, Terrific battery & within this Price Point...!!
",5,"

  Received this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MPFront, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp,  fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features & usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.

  Likes:- Excellent battery life: I have had Galaxy S series, Moto, Oppo, LeEco, and M31 by far exceeds every phone.- Camera: Provided decent light, the camera works like a charm.- Multitasker: At first, I was hesitant to go for the Exynos processor, as I haven't tried it before. Had experience of only Qualcomm processors, but Exynos handles the job very efficiently.- Screen size: Though it is a 6.4-inch device, it is easily single-handedly manageable.Dislikes:- Low light camera should have been better.- Somehow I feel, finger sensor at the back will not suit everybody's taste.

Camera- 64mp camera is provide in this phone but reality is different its looks like 32 mp camera and front camera is 32mp but reality looks like 16mp. Overall performance of camera is good not excellent.4. Battery- It has 6000 mah battery. Battery performance is very good but feature of fast charging is a joke. Battery takes 3 to 4 hours fully charged.5. Fingerprint reader is awsome.

I higely recoomend this mobile

  Well, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 128GB of internal storage.

Power packed Smartphone in pocket friendly price
",5,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.Samsung Galaxy M31 camerasI found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots

  One of the best phone to buy in a range of 15k -25k.I am feeling so happy while using it.Pros:- 1 - The processsor is super fast and we can easily multitask without any lag.2- The reason why i choose this phone over Redmi was the AMOLED display offered by samsung which is awesome. Now i can watch movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime with better picture Quality as it feels like i am watching in a theatre.3- Sound Quality is super as it provides with DOLBY ATMOS in this range .4- The amazing part is that it has a battery of 6000mah which is impossible to get from any great brand like Samsung. I charge it after 3 days if using on a normal basis.5- The camera of this phone makes your picture is being clicked by a DSLR. I have now started using this for clicking my pictures and stopped using my DSLRThis phone is a go ahead and experience the great features with it.I strongly recommend to go for Samsung M31

No Privacy and Security.

  This is not for professional users. This does not have any security feature. You cannot lock any app and it does not have any secured folder. It's required to store any password or important data. Some times our mobile will be used by friends or kids, during that time this phone is not useful ,No privacy or security. Installing third party apps for this purpose may be risky.I used J7 series earlier, in that feature was there whereas in m31 it's not there. I have seen many reviews and no one mentioned about this.Finger print reader you have search. Back cover and sensor almost  same texture.Charging is normal only not fast. Audio output in below speaker is not enough.When flash is used video is coming black  in slow motion camera.It's easily getting heated up. After video recording u cannot make call comfortably. Near ear piece it's hot.Overall I feel disappointed with the security feature.

Great phone! All the features are advertised by Samsung. #MegaMonster!

  I ordered this set on the first day and the delivery was amazing.All the features of this phone are as advertised. The outer body is same as that of Galaxy M30s and M30. A little on the thick side due to 6000mAh battery.Camera and battery life are excellent. The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.

  So i have been using this phone since past 10 days!!! And i am quite impressed with it. Obviously there are some cons also. Starting with the display,the display is amazing,watching movies or series is an absolute delight! Next battery life, it truly has a monstrous battery but apps like zoom and google meet consume a lot of battery,anyway the battery lasts easily for more than day even with heavy usage. Next is camera,it is kinda mixed feeling, front camera is no doubt great,however comparing to other phones in same price range,the rear  camera could be slightly better. In short both front and back camera are nice. The design of the phone however could be better. I am attaching two pictures as i didn't get opportunity to go out much,i wasn't able to click many pictures. At last,summarizing my review in a sentence,it is worth the price. Hope this review helps 😊

  Love the camera quality and the fingerprint reader option. Makes it so easy to open and use the phone.The battery life is good as I now charge my phone once in 1.5 days, instead of twice the same day with my previous smartphone.However, the phone may take a while to charge (precisely 2.5 hrs) despite of its fast charging feature. At first I thought this was a drawback only with my unit but then I realised it is with all M31.That is not such a big problem for me as the other features surpass everything else.

  The phone is awesome now almost I used this phone since 10 days its battery life is 6000mah a lot👍camera quality is very good the details are awesome on the macro cam or on normal and 64mp cam.Night camera is also good . Samsung give this  variant at very low price like 6,64 in 15999 and 6,128 in 16999. No one gives that 6,128 in RS1Ik more which is pretty cool. While other gives top variant in more rate. Display is super good. One main option its sound quality is good like in xaomi phone that I used it's on call hearing quality is super worst. In this phone the fingerprint and face unlock is little slow but it is ok. Its is light weight phone and its screen size makes it fully grip in hand. Its plastic back body makes it's less chance of fall from hand. Although the phone  is good . Gaming experience is too good as you can play pubg on top graphics almost 7hrs+ with no lag .The phone is full value for money.

  Galaxy M31 sports a rectangular camera module at the back in the top left corner. The camera setup comprises three camera sensors and an LED flash. There is a fingerprint scanner in the middle, followed by the Samsung branding at the bottom. Upfront, there is a waterdrop notch at the top and fewer bezels. The chin has a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and speaker grille (from left to right). The head doesn’t have anything. The left side of the smartphone is home to a SIM slot and the left side houses the volume rocker and the power on/off button. Speaking of the volume button, it is placed quite high and reaching it wasn’t as easy as it is on any other smartphone.The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch.The M31 is Samsung’s cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There’s plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it’s no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won’t have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.

  Affordable performance phone with an outstanding 64MP camera. Night shots are beautiful. Only suggestions would be a ready to use app lock and change the call record begin menu from the top corner as it ends up recording unnecessary calls as the top of our ear lobes touch the screen. Battery is really good and offers 2 day stamina. The UI is also pretty well tuned for easy use. Rating the finger print reader low as it does catch sweat and refuses to open unless cleaned, but response time is excellent. Could have been avoided with a slightly different back cover texture.

  The phone is amazing. The display and  graphics are awesome. The 128 GB storage allows a lot of space for your photos and videos. But the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the product has a problem with the speed as the 6 GB RAM version is not working like it was supposed to be. Also it doesn't have a some features like  multi window and you can't pin any application for not being cleared ot from the recent screen. The camera is amazing as it allows us to capture picture in different environment differently. The 64 Mp camera is worth it. The video quality is also amazing. It also has various other functions like Bixby vision, panorama,slow motion,super slow motion,AR emoji.It also has an inbuilt QR code scanner.

One of the best Non Chinese phones to buy at this price
",4,"

  First impressions - The super amoled screen quality is a bit oversaturated and the white looks a tad bit yellowish but can be worked with. The cameras are decent performers, not exceptional with the 64 mp and other lenses but not that bad also. Pictures are sharp and have less noise and good details in day light and somewhat decent even in artificial lighting. Performance is good and smooth for day to day work and the battery helps with that. Though it doesn't perform like a 6000 mah battery but still will get you over a full day. The charging takes around 2 and a half hours to go from 0 to 100. All in all its a pretty decent phone to use in 2020 and if you are just a normal user and want to use your phone for long periods of time without charging, then this is the one for you. I hope samsung provides regular updates so that this phone can be used for the next 2 to 3 years.

Best mobile phone under 20,000
",5,"

  This is the best mobile phone under Rs  20,000. My detailed review after a week of usage.1. Battery life - This phone has full day battery life. I don't have a television and mobile phone is my only source of entertainment. So you can imagine my usage pattern. I used to charge my old phone two times a day but not this beast. Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.Again i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting. Also there is pro mode and many other modes if you still need them.I have become a fan of this phone and a fan of samsung.No negative points so far , i will keep updating this review in future if i find anthing good or bad.

  The Phone is working pretty fine. The fingerprint is quick, Face recognition is good and it fails in dark and it took more time. Camera quality is good both front and back. Battery capacity is long and good. I never felt any heating of Phone. The memory is huge and it works smooth and fast. I recommend to buy this Phone if ur budget is in this range.

  Good phone , but needs to work on camera quality. Battery life is good, 100% charging take 3 hours which stands atleast 2 days with full use (movies, songs or regular stuffs)UI is good, but in auto rotate mode , if you are using phone while leaning, you don't have option to make it portrait till you make your phone verticals and then select portrait mode.Sound quality is good.Phone weight is moderate, but comparatively more than other samsung phones (J7 next).Overall worthy product at 17,500. As samsung is a good brand you don't need to worry about maintance, as they are durable for years.From my side it's 4 out of 5.

Very very slow charger
",5,"

  The phone is splendid. Superb camera, battery life. But Amazon sends it with a super slow charger (10W), may even take around 10 hours to charge the phone. And then the customer service would say, nowhere is it mentioned about the wattage, if you launch a complaint. There isn't a complaint about the phone. Worth the money. But the charger is bad. Get it from the official site preferably.

  The fingerprint reader is pretty fast and in at a very comfortable position and it doesnt disturb while gaming. The battery life is exceptionally good, i can easily make it though one whole day on a single charge (normal use and some gaming aswell). The camera quality is impressive and really i got what i was promised. Overall the mega monster lives up to it's name. Although this is a little thick phone but if it gives a great battery life i dont mind that. Also some people find that they dont get 64mp resolution so the simple solution to it is that there is a ratio aspect selection in the camers setting so we can change it as per our wants and requirements.

More than worth it
",5,"

  Finger print reader lags a bit and is not as fast as the phones other competitors whereas the camera is definitely worth the price (In fact more than value for money). I have compared M31's camera with other brands such as OnePlus and it gives them a competition (But obviously not overpowering them). Bettery life is something that I shouldn't even speak about, the phone lasts for more than 1.5 days for me and when full charged .... 😂 6000mah is all I need to say. This pgone overall is totally worth it, no lags as such. Samsung phones generally have poor GPS but there's no such problem with this phone. If you are looking for a phone under 15K then this should be your buy.

Daily Data Notification Missed

  Will be super great if there is an notification for daily data usage which synchronizes with data plan chosen by customer on any network provider (not on wifi network) and recycles on daily bases. So that We do not need to worry if the daily data limit is over or getting close to daily quota limit, also we can be tension free especially while having work from home (lock down period) or other heavy data utilizing time.Sorry to say this but right now mobile looks like riding a car or bike without knowing the petrol limit.Hope to have this feature in future updates.

Absolute gem from Samsung
",5,"

  Before reviewing my samsung M31, I would like to share what I was actually seeking in a phone.1. Best available battery life with fast charging2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube)3. A nice camera4. Good enough processor for multitasking5. Additional slot for expandable memoryThis M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.

Totally in love with Samsung Galaxy M31

  Have to admit that at first I was quite skeptical about buying the phone after reading a few negative comments, but much to my surprise, this phone Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6GB RAM, 64GB internal memory, Impressive Super Amoled Display, 6000mAh battery, 32MP front and 64MP Quad Camera is superlative in all the aspects.  Sound quality and touch sensitivity are amazing too. All in all a very good phone. It's quite light and ergonomically well-balanced due to its plastic body. The processor Samsung Exynos 9611 is also quite fast and the interface is quite intelligible as well as easy-to-handle. Picture quality is great along with a plethora of modes like night mode, macro, slow-mo, super slow-mo, pro mode,  hyperlapse etc.

Value for money | Handy | Great Camera | Lightweight

  Value for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.

The front camera gives u to ways to enhance Ur beauty like smoothening the face and making Ur eyes look bigger. The battery life is amazing as one time charging can last up to two days with Ur data or WiFi on the whole day. The fingerprint readability is very quick. Within a flash of seconds it reads Ur fingerprint even with Ur wet hands. Moreover the phone runs very smoothly even with lots of apps, documents and pictures. The screen is till the edge of the phone which gives a super hd quality to watch any videos with numerous editing options. Overall feature of the phone is superb and gives Excellent results.

My unbiased opinion on Samsung M31
",5,"

  Writing this review after using the phone for 2 months. So here's the goods and the bads of the product-The goods:-1) The phone stands its claim for the battery life.  It does gives a lasting battery in single charge.2) The camera is the key selling point. And it is actually if not the best then better than all other phones of this price range.3) The display is also nice. The aspect ratio plus the resolution both stands at the claim.4) The fingerprint reader works fast.The bads:-1) The phone looks cheap as the built is of plastic.2) Due to 6000 mah Battery, the phone is bulky and in long term usage becomes hard to be lifting up.3) Samsung provides many applications in the phone which are not necessary and one cannot uninstall them. These eats up space for no reason.

   Everything is Super Duper. All expectations from Samsung about this phone  came true. I was waiting for this phone since February when I listened on Amazon.The Battery 6000 MH and 6 GB RAM is enough for playing PubG and other Games without any Problems. 64 Mega pixels camera is good for capturing our memories. Mobiles look is slim and wait only 191gm with 6.4 inch screen. One more thing which I like is dual 4g support sim which was my problem in my Old Model J5 Prime.I always used Only Samsung phone (after Nokia keypad) in my Life.

  Good phone in this budget and better than mi redminote 8 pro.First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good

A good budget phone.
",5,"

  Using it for the last 4-5 days and here is what I feel about itLikes:The display is really good and considering other three important aspects, camera is really nice, as of battery for a regular use after charging it went on for nearly 2 days and Fingerprint reader response is fast. Doesn't heat up during regular use, haven't used for playing games so can't say much about that.Dislikes:The sound from the speaker is low, mobile feels a little heavy, so can't hold it for long. Missing the led notification light, I loved that feature from my last mobile phone(but it is also good, less distraction). Hearing a hissing sound during phone calls, still have to check whether it is a problem with the speaker or the network problem.

A magnificent combo of Premium A series in budget model

  So at the price this is an amazing phone. The various sensors which we never realise are required in a budget model is also present in this. It's better than many A series models due to Camera qlty. What till now Samsung m model lacked was a good camera which this one has proved to be false. The variations of the wide angles are more visible in this series. The Android 10v with many additional features of A series makes this phone the best model to pickup. The touch, screen and other details are as good as always fron a brand like Samsung

Because in this internet generation we need to assure that we're getting enough speed for network.Overall its a mega monster with in this price range.

  It's a very great phone. Especially at this price. The battery life is nice.. though I use it a lot for gaming so it may seem less but is definitely better than other phones. Camera quality is great. But I would recommend samsung to add a feature in the camera. We should be able to lock the exposure while recording a video... otherwise any movement causes the exposure to change hence not giving a nice feel to the video.RAM holds up well. But I feel bad that there is no secure folder or even screen recorder feature. It is there for game launcher but not for anything else. The phone would really be the best choice if these features were available.

Battery that seems to last for ever

  Great phone at this price. Real monster battery and 64 MP 4 camera rear camera, both make this a one of ours kind phone. I'm a heavy user and battery easily lasts for 2 days. 15 Watts fast charger is not as good as 25 watts new generation chargers but once in 2 days can easily spare 1.5 hrs for charging.Fingerprint sensor is not in screen or in button and is slower then other phones but has better responsiveness then other similar phones.Camera is definately a charm for having 4 camera rear camera, though picture quality doesn't look like that of 64 MP.

  No doubt the best handset in this price segment. You will be surprise to hear that I've upgraded my one plus 7pro with Samsung M31. I'm very satisfied with the performance. Only 2 drawbacks from my side 1. Face unlock is not so fast like Oneplus. 2. Will take 2.5 hours to get full recharge.Another thing - Samsung has not made original cover for M31. Which is not acceptable. You will hardly find a good cover for M31 in eCommerce sites.

  This is a good phone, absolutely perfect for those who need a phone just for web browsing, facebook and whatsapp. Battery is excellent. I personally own this phone and I get more than 1 month on average use. 6000mAh battery is more than enough for me. At first I had issued with the big screen sized phone but I got used to it later on.I have no qualms on camera because I am not a camera person.Processor is good enough. I am using the 6gb RAM version and its blazing fast.Phone calls are clear and speaker is good.People who say bad about this phone have never probably used this phone. They probably must be salesmen of other brands.I will give this फोन 9/10.

  Fingerprint sensor is actually very good but some times, it doesnt responds to my finger and this problem get solved once i click powerbutton twice and try again. the battery life seems like a good one . The max screen on time i got is 12hrs.note that im a gamer, and i spend 4 or 5hrs a day gaming. Video calling takes a lot of charge than gaming. Everytime when i open camera, battery drains too fast.then face recognition unlock is too slow, cant say its bad but is very slow and not ultra fast like that on iphone. Camera is actually very good.liked it so much. Its storage and ram is amazing and processor is also good.i didnt felt any lag while playing pubg. Actually its a good phone, but you know everything has some disadvantages, and like that this has some too. But like a total review, this is love.❤

Big batteryCONSBiggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor5.As it is 10nm technology  it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.

  I have been using the 64Gb variant of this phone for about two weeks now and is extremely pleased with the product. As a user who isn't much into the technicalities of the phone and mainly focuses on the simpler parts like the memory, camera, sound quality and performance, I find this to be a gem. The functioning is smooth and easy. The cameras, both the rear cam and the selfie cams are exceptionally good. The biometric scanner works at the speed of light with any lag. The sound quality and picture quality of videos played on the phone is remarkable. The only thing thay bugs me about the phone is the fact that the audio jack of the phone is on the underside, next to the charging port with makes ne a little uncomfortable. Overall It's a great product at a great price. I would totally recommend this phone, go for it without the hint of a doubt. 👍

  The phone itself works perfectly. A great camera, a long lasting battery and an awesome display are the main features of the phone in my opinion. It does fall a bit backward in processing capabilities as compared to some other phones in the mid range , but as I don't game a lot of mobile , I really didn't see this as an issue. The phone may not be able to play games such as PUBG in high settings , but once the graphics is lowered it should handle it no problem. As for the other features the charging does take a considerable amount of time but it is expected as a huge 6000 mah battery is given which last for well over a day even with my extreme usage.I would say go for it. It is one of the best mid rangers in the market and definitely one if the best ones that samsung have released in recent times.

Best featured Quality mobile but very average camera quality
",5,"

  Best Quality, various useful features. But the finger print sensor is working little bit slow. Sometimes it doesn't recognize. Face Recognition is not worthy. And the main point is camera. Actually, i was using galaxy j7 prime. In that camera quality is very super. But I expect galaxy M31 camera has improved version. But i totally upset about image quality of Galaxy M31. Atleast samsung put galaxy j7 prime camera to the galaxy M31. I mean the features of the camera are best. Optimize photo capturing is amazing features but the image quality is very poor. Other than camera, the best mobile in this budget. But i guess, all people are buying mobile based on camera quality. So, samsung must improve image quality.

  Writing this review after a week of usage1. Amazing battery life, even after using Netflix + PUBG + Always on display for 5 hours, saw only 50% battery drain.2. Amoled screen has very good color saturation.3. Camera is good enough for my purposes, got decent night time pics.Caveats: 1. You have to select ""natural"" in the color saturation options, vivid is quite extreme2. The default camera setting is 16 MP. You need to explicitly select 64MP as an aspect ratio (?!!) in the camera settings.

Amazing but needs improvement

  Amazing phone at this price! Two things that it needs to be improved and those are the front camera quality and the battery. Even though Samsung has claimed that it is a 6000mah battery and I have been using the phone for the past one month, it usually drain quite quickly. One thing I love most in this phone is the night mode which is quite impressive. One more cons that I have come across is, while using rear camera for clicking photos in zoom mode, the picture is not so good. Apart from this, everything is perfect at this price range.

So satisfied with product that reviewing after using almost 15 days. NOTE- i normally don't review.Thanks Amazon for early delivery.One more best thing is It is Manufactured in India( zoom the image and u can see).I will suggest anyone buying the phone just order a back cover with the mobile As the back is polycarbonate.

A must buy if you are in need for a good camera and battery
",4,"

  I have been using this phone for the past 2 days now and here’s what I have to say:1. It’s battery backup is amazing. Even if you continuously watch netflix and other stuff, then also you’ll be able to manage a battery backup of 1.5 days.2. It’s a very eye friendly screen and doesn’t give any stress to the eyes even if you continuously watch videos.3. Dark mode is just awesome with a very dark experience.Here’s what I didn’t like:1. They could have given a 18w fast charger with the device as it takes approximately 160 minutes to charge from 0-100%.2. Speaker misses out the true sound detail.3. A plastic back attracts a lot of scratches even if you treat it like a baby.Otherwise, it’s a very good phone in this price point but if you’re a rough user then you might want to keep a cover ready as soon as you order the device.Hope this review will be helpful 👍🏻

Amazing M31 with Good features

  I use the product more as a phone, but the graphics - playing games or watching videos is amazing. its very light weight. I wanted phone with good memory and storage area which i got it. The camera quality is also good. Samsung has given all the features in one phone which are necessary for any person. overall its a very good product by Samsung.

  First of all it's worth for money. As it advertised megabattery has a mega standby time. Charge stands 2 days for normal use. Camera quality at it's best when you have enough lighting. Depth sensor and macro doing its job at best. Fingerprint scanner is very fast. You dont know whether you touched or not. Even face unlock does its job good. Processor also fine. Phone didn't heat up even you play pubg or freefire for more than 30 minutes.

  really amazed by the battery back up. 2 days !.... most importantly the quality of pictures and display options are much better than other competitors. the only game i play is ludo and sometimes gaurdians of sky....so no issue over there...touch and screen is also awesome.i did not like the position of the finger sensor. it is quite above but people hold the phone from lower part so one has to do extra effort to move the finger upward to touch the sensor. the phone is very slippery so not for people who handle phone roughly.बाकी सब ठीक है और 17.5 k में और इससे ज्यादा क्या चाहिए ! वैसे भी 3 साल भी अच्छे से चल गया मतलब पैसा वसूल ।

True monster
",5,"

  As the caption by the company tells, it's indeed a monster. Battery is a beast. Started at 30% and played 4 battle royale games. Battery drained only by 7%.Finger print sensor is highly responsive and even the face unlock feature.But camera requires but more stability. If you have an extremely stable hands while taking pictures, you'll definitely get masterpieces. But if your hand shakes, edges become a bit hazy. After all 64MP at this price range is unbelievable. So these small mistakes can be forgiven.

Ease of use
",5,"

  While drop down on the main screen, we should be in a position to select  and place our icons and easily use them instead of searching for them. Earlier I could arrange screen shot icon like that easily use it. And there should be an additional security by a password for our gallery/ photos, so that others cannot easil see our personal photos. Similarly all personal apps like Whatsapp, or any, as we choose, can be protected by separate access passwords. When we want to type text in mail,WhatsApp, Twitter..etc., we need a facility,whereby if we can select a language and then dictate by voice, it should type it,editable by us and then finally post,to increase comfort. This is regarding Samsung M31 phone

Truly a Mega monster 🔥😈

  This is one of the best budget smartphone by Samsung 🔥❤️. Is has 64 mega pixels primary camera which click best quality images and the selfie camera is 32 mega pixels. There is a feature where the camera itself suggests you the angle to click the best shot. The amoled display gives best experience while watching movies. Also the battery is 6000 mAh battery which last for 2 days minimum. This is a good package deals in recent smartphones and the mobile is manufactured in India ❤️. Best part about this device is is doesn't show you stupid ads like Chinese phones and your data is secured. U should definitely buy this phone if u have budget below 20k 😌

  I've used this product for nearly 10 days and now I'll share its Pros and Cons.Pros1) It has a great battery life.2) The display is bright and rich in details.3) Camera is very good (But i would say one of the best in this price segment).4) Sound output is good.5) Overall design is good sleek and light weight.6) Samsung UI's user experince is easy and stutter free.Cons1) The phone seems to be a little slippery.2) Gets warm while playing heavy graphics games Pubg or pes ( was a bit disappointed). But it's Kay when you keep the settings under balanced or medium graphics. Not recommended for heavy gamers.3) Plastic body doesn't give a classy look.4) Charging speed is very slow (But you have to accept it for the bigger battery size). Takes approx 2.5 hours for 0-100%.

Excellent option at cheapest price in the range!

  Though I was apprehensive to buy this phone after using my previous One Plus 5 for the last 3 yrs yet I  must say that this by far the best decision I have made in the month! #M31 is a monster rightly as highlighted in their ads constantly. Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.

  Everything is good in this phone like from build design to battery all are good all hardware components and softwares even are the best chosen products by Samsung. And one more thing I would like to say about its camera yes it clicks the picture as natural as it is. And the battery is good enough to let you use it about 9 hour even if you use it hardly. One thing I didn't love but like is it's back case.

Probably the best camera under ₹20k.The samsung OneUI is also great and makes it feel like a premium phone with minimal bloatwareThe phone is amazing everything about it is great.You must consider buying this phoneThe other chinese variants have a lot of bloatware.The only con of the phone is that it takes a lot of time to charge.

  Samsung galaxy m31 is really fantastic phone. No phone is best under mid range but still I find this device is one of favourite device as this is completely secure device, user interface is awesome, camera is a bit of disappointed but for me camera is not everything neither game, beyond this I am really happy to have this phone. Samsung is well known for hardware and which proves it again, display is also thumb sup, still the time I did not face any lag issue with device, I definitely recommend the one who are apart from game only, rest is really satisfying for me as I am a corporate user.

Macro lens is great.  I usually take less selfies. But the  selfie cam is pretty decent.Charging time for this device is long because of the monster battery.I do not play games on mobile phones.

Value for money, except for dash charging
",5,"

  I changed to Samsung M31 from One Plus 3, which I was using for 3.5+ years. This phone was a major upgrade for me. Quad- camera, super Amoled screen and humongous battery are the super cons of the phone. Being a non-gamer, I have no issues with the performance. But, overall the phone is absolute value for money. I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.2. The speaker could have been a bit louder. It's not bad, but could have been better.3. The phone is not meant for heavy gamers.4. Camera UI could be improved a lot and could me made more clean and clutter-free.

  Overall it is a very good phone for a perfect price1. It has 6000 mAh power battery and a15w fast charger which is pretty good but the length of the charger included could improve2. It has a very fast finger print sensor at a good location; making it very comfortable to almost everyone.3.It has very good camera (64mp which is just outstanding!!), but the only down side is that ar emoji is not very good and it is kind of disturbing to look at it.I conclude that the, phone is fabulous and wonderful, the hardware is excellent but the software needs thorough improvement, this is because of things like Bixby, AR emoji, sound problems etc.Thanks for reading my review hope you knew something new about Samsung m31 Space black.

  Its a great phone and everything is just monsterous but one thing that i find bad about this phone is that the phone has plastic back which takes lots of fingerprints and thus problems somrthimes on fingerprint senser also...other than that the camera is just amazing but it doesnt have night mode but in day light its fab. Its display is super good because even if you have bad network connection and cant play videos in higher setting you can watch it in lower setting but because of screen it will give you an mosterous effect. The battery is the major high light of this phone if you have more than 90% battery you can use it whole day without any pause but then also you will find some percent left in the battery bank.Thank youSamar Chauhan (an ordinary user of galaxy m31)

Great Phone with a Few Drawbacks
",4,"

  I've been using this phone for the past 1 week and I've loved the phone. There are both ups and downs to this device like this has an amazing battery but it takes time to completely charge it, which is obvious considering its size. The display is beautiful to look at, the colours are vibrant and it gets extremely bright. But the back is plastic which feels cheap. The phone comes with a proper fast charger in the box but misses out on a phone case. The cameras on the phone are nothing to brag about, they are alright at this price point.To summarise this is a great phone with a few bits of cost saving here and there, which is to be expected at this price point. But the goods far outweigh the little bads which can be neglected. Like amazing screen and battery.

  So I received this mobile on 16 march and started using it by 19 mar. Bought it to beat the looming lockdown at the time. Held me in good stead as I ran my office from this mobile only. Best part of mobile is its battery backup. With all the use I still get 24 hrs of backup. Camera quality was not my requirement but still I find it good. The touch screen and fingerprint are also great. Face recognition at times plays mischief, but its manageable.  At times it start blinks when moved from one app to the other but it may be more due to my own issue. Overall till now it has been a great experience.

My view about Samsung galaxy M31
",5,"

  The display quality is certainly better than what we usually see in this price range.  As mentioned above, the display is shielded by Gorilla Glass 3 (which is more scratch-resistant, but less drop resistant than GG 5 and GG6).  There is no pre-installed scratch guard or plastic screen protector on the phone.Battery life a massive 6,000mAh cell and the company claimed the device can deliver up to 26 hours of video playback and yes, it did live up to the expectations. During the review period, the Galaxy M31 consistently offered two days of the battery under ...overall Camera quality , the camera performance is above average in proper lighting conditions. Indoors and in low light, the quality deteriorates.Fingerprint Reader is work good.....

  First of all the phone related to a company whom you can trust among all brands available in market in this range 'The SAMSUNG'. Secondly the battery backup of phone is very good and it can easily survive for 2 days. Third the camera quality is superb and you can click good pictures with perfect pixels. Fourth the fingerprint reader experience is average as sometimes you have to put your fingers more than once on the panel to unlock the phone. Fifth when I make calls on the phone with speaker mode, sometimes I feel like my voice echo so I have to low the volume and the problems seems fixed. Sixth the look of the phone is very premium and you can carry it easily as the weight is also not much.

The processor is always ready for heavy performance and multitasking, Idle for gaming and high graphics work, amazing sound experience on Dolby Atmos .

Phone with Higher battery or expectation?
",5,"

  I have used this phone for past two months what I found that battery life is amazing when 100% charged and used with 4G connection through out day. At a very heavy usage like 3 hours Movie, 2 hrs gaming (like candy crush), it does great in M31. However when in standby mode at night (with wifi on) it is behaving miserable. One night it will consume more than 10% battery in standby and another night just 3%. This behaviour I am unable to understand. Camera performance is also quite good with 64MP camera, Slow motion (requires practice) live focus mode etc.The cons I feel it is while continously using it sometimes it became sluggish and yes you feel like it hangs up.I recommend this phone to only user who cares for battery and camera.

An awesome phone with a poor charger
",5,"

  The phone's specs was awesome on the ads but the experience was a little unsatisfying. The display, camera and the UI is the best in this range. But the performance,battery life and the charger is not as expected. The processor is not the best and a snapdragon would have been a better choice. The battery lasts for 24 hours for a normal use but when you are a user for more than 8 hours you need to charge it again on the night itself and the 6000mah battery takes 2 hours 30 mins for a full charge, which could have been avoided by providing a powerful charger. Nevertheless, an average phone when comparing with its Chinese competitors. But I prefer Samsung instead of other Chinese ones..

  I like the speed n space available in this handset. You can easily open several apps without affecting the speed. The sensitivity to touch is very good. There is no heating found in many others. Having free MS office pre-installed is another good thing. The weight is also low as compared to many other handsets with same screen size. I have not used the camera, hence cannot comment about it.About battery. I charge in the morning to 100%. But by next morning, it is drained to just 30-32%. Secondly, many unwanted apps are pre-installed which are taking the space. I am unable to have the clock on the screen. For deleting a message, you need to press thrice, which is surprising.

Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.

  Newly purchased samsung m31 quite satisfied with the phone. In fact, loving this #MegamonsterThings to know before buyingM31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10) which is out-of-the-box.A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features – Always-On Display, Ultra Data Saving, and Dual Messenger – that add to the package.6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and  the sunlight legibility is also quite good.It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! SamsungThe Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a 64-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a 5-megapixel macro sensor, and a 5-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range32 MP selfie camera is amazing.It supports slow motion, live focus as well Overall phone is awesome. If looking for a phone under 15000, I would suggest this is best phone in the market with samsung brand value.

Great phone at a Great price
",5,"

  The product is handy, the display is very good and so is the battery.But don't expect too much from the 6000 mAH battery. The features are great and the sensors work good.Sound:Sound is loud but clear. You wont be needing to attach it to a speaker when indoors. There is a special Dolby Effect for speakers which you probably should give a try. It is great.Biometrics:Phone is supported with Finger print scanner and Face unlock. And these are surprisingly fast as compared to its prior versions.Apps:Most apps are supported but some utility app like Samsung Pay etc is not yet supported by the phone. Please work on it.Gaming:So far so good. I have tried out pubg and Asphalt. The games work flawless and phone doesn't heat up as expected.9.5/10 for overall performance10/10 at this price rangeYou can definitely go forward and get your hands on it.

  First, delivery by Amazon was lightning  fast, took only 3 days to reach, 1 day in advance!Now the device.  It is a powerful  device having long life battery  backup, last almost  2 days once 100% recharge  is done. 6GB RAM makes it easy to use multiple  apps at the same time. Keypads are easy to use, touch feels very light. 128 GB of internal  memory helps to store everything, no need to have external  SD card.Go for it!

  Nice one from Samsung. Camera, battery is superb. But about amazon pls do keep a watch on price. When I bought this one. The same model with 128 GB had 4000 rs difference. When I ordered 64 gb product the next day 128 gb price was decreased and there was mere a difference of 1000 rs. Bad luck I didn't order the 128 gb model

  Phone is excellent. Battery is really good. Need to charge only daily once inspite of many apps. Fast charging with c type charger makes life easy. Camera quality is superb. Quad camera with 64mp gives superb picture Quality. One extra slot for memory card allow to increase memory without compromising on sim. My redmi had only two slots so had to use only one sim by sacrifying other for memory card.Weight is the only thing which bothered me it is heavier  than my previous redmi note 4 phone which had similar battery.Overall the phone is excellent and value for money.

The best mid-ranger smartphone till now(Under 15k)

  I'm reviewing this product after using for a week..It is absolutely an beast in this price segment..One thing about Samsung is that..Its super amoled display,security and build  ...-SOFTWARE:8.5/10The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features-DISPLAY:9/10The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment-BATTERY:10/10The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..-SOUND:9/10The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..-CAMERA:7.5/10As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future-Fingerprint reader is very fast-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it.

One of the nice mobile under 16k

  Overall phone is nice. I purchased this handset at 14k with exchange for my father and it fulfils his day to day need perfectly. The battery backup is very good. Mostly he was using it for calling, YouTube, whatsapp and listening songs. As per the usage the battery backup is obviously good since battery size is also huge. Display is the USP of this mobile and it is the best hands down. So overall if you're looking for handset for a handset for your parent under 15k it's one of the best model you may consider.

  Pros:1.Got a very nice macro camera.2.Battery life is superb.3.Fast fingerprint sensor.4.Not much heavy, is hand and pocket friendlyMost of you came for the cons soCons:1.Had some UI issues in the first few starting days in which the glance icon always uses to show in the notification bar blocking notification. Later resolved.2. Not a night camera u would expect.3. A bug which automatically turns on the screen and plays a specific sound as seen in most samsung phones is also seen but i think it will be resolved.Overall a better budget phone in comparision to other phones. Samsung did try to improve the standard of their mid-range phones but people shouldn't expect a lot from those.

Samsung M31 upset

  Hello peoples, I have purchased this M31 Last month 18 March, am totally upset due to Samsung M31 because of more gaps in this M31. I will tell problem -> 1. Macro camera ( in ad they show small boat photo veŕy clearly from a distance but actually it not like that.2. Only they additional  camera and increase the mega pixel.Additional macro camera totally waste.3. Battery - 6000MA ok , when I put charge it take 4 to 5 hrs for full charge.When i compare to my moto g3 it take 2hrs only for full charge in normal charge. Charging time  it take too much of time , it waste.4. Mobile security, actually I interest in A50S for two main reason one for NFC and other one KNOX Security.in M30 I don't know actually condition.But I had review Spec of M31 in GSMARENA ,NFC is available depend on market,I saw many review none one not say about NFC they not no about that.Due to KNOX Security, NFC, Battery charging time, Macro camera it totally  upset my mind on the first day of my purchase it self.If any development in exist mobile model kindly do some improvement.Positive point , 6GB ram It working well.

Amazing phone M31
",4,"

  I'll start by saying this is the best Birthday gift I have purchased for myself, also my First Samsung phone.I will start with the my experience with the phone so far.Speed:- Great speed and touch response and Apps opening time is amazing- Phone boot up is quite fast- Fingerprint and face ID is very fast compared to In-display fingerprint- Gaming experience is good tooCamera:- Attached the shots, see the amazing close up and night mode- Super amoled display shows the  best possible colors- Steady camera, till not I haven't got a single blur picture or out of focus, which is amazing- Image process is impressive, no time delay in capturing and saving the imagesLooks:Trust if if anything matters the most to me is the looks of the phone, this phone looks amazing and quite attractiveOne small issue - a bit slippery, but a cover would take care of it. I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.Features:Fast ChargingAndroid 10 One UI2Memory Card slotBest - 3.5 mm Audio JackDolby Atmos sound6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usageCharting time is about 30-45 minutesNO ADs - The best partSound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I loveTo be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.Assistant is also quite nice.For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segmentSamsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks

  Talking about Samsung Galaxy M31, it is an amazing phone to spend money on. Some people say that Samsung has been using the same processor in most of its mobile ranges, but it seems to be best as per my opinion, as Qualcomm Snapdragon has been recently accused for stealing data, and on the other side, Mediatek Processors lack on remaining cool. So, I focused on the point on which the wishing buyers change the mind, and I did not highlight points about camera which is seemingly amazing, display which is bright and sharp and battery which is gigantic, because everyone get attracted to it, but after knowing the processor, they usually change their decision.Conclusion: It is a nice phone for daily usage and you should go for it.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 17,000 It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support.Coolest thing is  have 6000 mAh battery so you can play games, movies etc.1: Best device in cheap price margin...love the battery backup 6000 MAhSuper processor for fast response of system.2:Best thing is the main USB of the phone, its 64 MP quad camera, shoots amazing photos and video. Also the front camera is very good. Have smooth performance while playing games like PUBG,GTA,ASPHALT,F1.We also have 6000 mAh battery so you can play games, movies etc.And high graphic quality in multiple game categoriesSuper amoled display for experiencing the best color visuals and movies and gameplay.3.The finger sensor at back center on mobile help me to unlock and use notifiaction bar very comfortably,quickly and with single hand use.

Gives others a run for their money. Worth more than the price!

  I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ₹14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use nowWhat i liked:-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.-Android 10 & One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.What I didn't like-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.

  I am writing this review after 10 days.1.CAMERAI found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.2.BATTERYThe 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.3.DISPLAYPerfect, no problem with that.4.VALUE FOR MONEYthe best from devices in this price segment.5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCKfinger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that.

But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.PROS1.BIG BATTERY2.AWESOME DISPLAY3.GREAT CAMERA4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNERCONS1.LACKS FOCUS ON THE MACRO MODE CAMERA2.THE PHONE HEATS SOMETIMES BUT MANAGABLE.3.FRONT CAMERA IS NOT SOO GOOD AT NIGHT TIME.3.FELLS A LAG ON SLOWMOTION VIDEOS

  Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without doubtbest thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India seller. I ordered on the first day 5th March 2020 of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 50% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!!  Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received two day later  by 6 pm!Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  The phone is really a mega monster and well worth the price. 128GB and 6GB RAM, 6000mAh battery along with a decent processor and camera is a steal at this price range. But my camera seems to have a problem where all the corners of the photo except a central circle become blurry and so i cannot take a whole picture of even a page. It might be a hardware problem in my device or it could be a software problem as well. Besides this issue the phone works great.

  Even though on the bulkier side compared to A and S series, M31 is a great phone given the 6000mah battery. This lasts me the whole day on a single charge.The charger could have been 18+watts and the cable length is pathetic. Not even 0.8 M.

  Firstly i mention the worst thing about this phone, 1. The time taken by the phone for full charge. It's more than 2 hours, but I am satisfying by the battery backup. It's good.2. The back panel is not scratchproof.  The positive things are below which attracted me to itself 1. The screen is awesome. The gorilla protection which I have experienced is unbelievable when my phone is dropped but no scratches on it.2. Camera is awesome, specially front camera. It's giving awesome selfies. Back camera shots are true hd.i am giving 5 star to the camera. Auto focus mode is needed for macro mode.3. Face lock is working within quarter of secondsAll over,The phone is very good in mid range phones

  At this price the phone is perfectly fine for daily browsing and stuff with Great super amoled screen.Phone gets heated while playing medium end games, so not a phone for gaming.Finger print scanner is perfectly placed at the rear of the phone and is not that fast as other budget phones. Half of the time the finger print sensor does not even respond to touch.The battery life is very good, will give at least 2 days of backup on 100% charge. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS IT TAKES AGES TO CHARGE 0%-100% With inbox 15watt fast charger. It takes around any where between 3.5 to 5 hours to charge 0% to 100%. Also this phone does not even support high end fast chargers i.e. 25watt so on.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn’t too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn’t have a glass back, it doesn’t come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn’t really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features

Budget phone with awesome specs!!!

  This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...

Amazing SmartPhone. Perfect for any person

  The overall product is very niceAt this price range if there is a phone to suggest this would be the one .The camera is decent not very good if we compare it to High end phones. But it is good if we compare it with any other under 20k phone.About the battery, it is very nice. The battery is huge like I use it for the whole day without charging it and yet there is some battery left.Gaming experience is decent not so good but definitely not bad. I play PUBG on this device and performs pretty very well.Moreover the built quality is good and also looks good when someone notices it .

  I am old user of samsung mobile and i am big fan of samsung display...so for display 5 out of 5 stars...For camara : i can give 4.5 out of 5 stars...-0.5 because of Samsung captures some high saturated picture.so same for m31 also.For battery life : 5 out of 5 stars...coz you can go for 1 full day with 6000 mah battery..For charger : it takes 2 to 2.5 h to get full charge so charger is fast but not so fast.For performance: 4.5 out of 5 stars as per performance...i am using m31 from last aprox 20 days...i didnt notice any single lag in this phone...-0.5 coz of gaming performance...m31 is good but not that much...But overall you can surely go for it...this is my genuine opinion on m31...Budget phone with extra budget facilities...i m satisfied with my purchase...Thank youGood product with good price

  I was skeptical about the product, since this mobile is not available offline thus not available to check in-hand from any retail shop. But, I am happy that I chose this phone. Let me be totally honest and tell you the pros and cons of this phone according to me.PROS:Display, Camera setup and performance, Battery life, Privacy. (also it's Made in India)CONS:Processor (in comparison to some of the options available in its price segment).Note: I have uploaded some pics I took with the camera in a cloudy weather.

  I will keep this review short, and from the point of view of an average user. Moved from an Iphone 7 (poor signal reception, disappointing battery life). Super AMOLED display is very engaging, (reading books is comfortable, even in dim light) 6000 mAh battery, powerful camera (miss the OIS though). Only complaint is the processor, which can get overwhelmed at times. Keep in mind the form factor, this one can get quite large with a case on it. Most importantly, the SAR value is low (around 0.3 Head SAR). Overall, extremely happy with the purchase.

Samsung M31 Review
",5,"

  I have used this phone for over 1 week now. Some of the plus points:1. I am a phone addict. Which means I use my phone for over 5 hours everyday. If you charge your phone to a 100%, you would definitely not need to charge if the next day.2. The camera quality is amazing. Prior to this I was using Moto G5 plus, which is also quite good in terms of camera quality. But this phone also offers a live focus feature. You can see the images for yourself to judge.3. The look of the phone is quite sleek. No issues at all.Some things that can be improved:1. The layout of the keypad can be improved to make it a little broader.No other issues at all. For 16,500 this is an awesome buy.

This is the Monster device from Samsung
",5,"

  I liked this product because it has a awesome sAmoled display and has monster 6000mAh battery. I have got upto 2 days of battery back up with this. The camera quality is better when it is compared to my other phones. Its fingerprint scanner is very faster and I liked it very much. The thing I didn't like is it takes upto 2 and a half hours to charge. The other one I didn't like is its GPU. It is the oldest GPU of Mali and the performance is not as much good. But for normal use it is only needed and it is not good for an intesive gaming. Overall I liked this phone very much. Thank you samsung for this monster samsung. I gave a rating of 4.8/5 for this device

  It's been 10 days since I am using M31. The mobile functions smoothly, has a very good quality front and back camera and battery lasts for around 30 hrs (depends upon individual usage as well). The design is sleek and surface is non slippery. I had a hard time while configuring the phone for first time. Overall good purchase and value for money.

  M31 is a mega budget phone. I bought it after comparing it with the latest Redmi and Oppo phones. And I am very happy with it. After using it for 15 days I have not faced any issues so far.  The pros:1. Good battery life2. Good set of cameras3. Smooth touch and fingerprint sensors4. Digital wellbeing feature lets you concentrate on your work and monitor your daily activitiesThe cons:1. The back cover doesn't look premium. And there are only 2 color variants. Boring.

Amazing Camera and Battery Life.

  Hi Guys, Writing Review after using the device for almost 2 weeks. TBH, I was about to buy Redmi Note 8 pro which is in same price range as this one but after thorough comparison i bought Samsung M31.Pros :1. Amazing camera. Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am  always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.Cons:1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.3. Back of the phone does not feel premium. Feels like a plastic coverup.

  Im a non gamer user , in need of a phone with very good camera and Battery Life and M31 met me with my wishes in built.Screen Quality is Pure Class with the SAmoled Display... Amazing Camera and battery life is the trump card..Easily lasts for one and half days with browsing,Netflix , Google meet classes , Camera usage (normal , heavy camera usage can drain battery in a faster rate) etc.  Fast fingerprint reader. Disappointed for only one thing ,the 15W fast charger.. It takes almost 3 complete hours to charge from 0 to 100 . Samsung please provide a better fast charger for ur upcoming 6000mah battery phones.. Happy with every other specs. Go for it guys if u r a non gamer , camera quality and battery life are the priorities .

  Best phone in 16000 rs range.... I really like the battery life....the storage capacity is also good..The camera quality written is 64 megapixel , but not felt like it . The camera is good in the range , kaam chal jayega , of you are purchasing in this range.I also like its power mode and the dark mode.The cons are - 1. The screen quality is not up to mark, not like gorilla glass. My mobile screen broked 2 days after purchase when it was without any screen protector.2. The face detection is not good, it takes a little long to open.3. The speaker is put below which does not produce a good sound.I would like to tell you that it is like a king of all Mobiles in its range.

  I use the Samsung Galaxy M31 since March 2020. It is the best phone ever I have been used. It's my 5th phone but I liked it most even i used I phone 5S,I liked it bcs the smoothness,very fast fingerprint reader,Monster battery-it is amazing,the 64MB camera also helped me in my travellings too. Even in my international trip also I don't used to use digital camera. The 64 MB Samsung Mega Monster was enough.The only corns we can say just is it's back cover,its an average.The overall performance and usings were since last 6 months was enough than more in this price range. I thank to Samsung for this product.Overall it's very useful no worries go ahead.

It's macro lens captures a lot of details.It even has a food mode which is a plus point for me.Its overall build is also quite sturdy and is easy to handle with even one hand.Its display is quite bright and vibrant with deep contrast.Its performance is very fast and smooth and will easily handle heavy games

Best phone in this price range with extra specifications.

  My budget was 20k and I decided to buy Samsung Galaxy M31. Delivery was done on promised date amid covid conditions. The phone has a very classy design, even having so powerfull battery of 6000mah the phone weighs lite. Camera is really amazing, gives you extraordinary picture quality specially in outdoor conditions. Played some heavy games too and ran some heavy apps too, did not experience any sort of lag. Also, dropped the phone in a bucket of water by mistake just after 2 days I got the phone. I was surprised to see that the phone was working fine as usual. It's been a week I don't see any problem with the phone even getting dropped in water. Worth buying it, best option for this price range. Go for it, samsung never disappoints with it mobile phones.

  The phone has excellent battery performance. Processor is bullet fast, even though I've a M31 8 GB, 128 GB variant but it's not showing up on the selection panel. The best part is that it keeps battery for two days long. The screen performance is excellent. The 16 MP & 64 MP camera performance rocks. The screen size is excellent to watch any video and cinema.For a regular and professional user who mostly watch videos, take snaps of nature and outdoor activities, reads lots of research articles, works on PPT and words, excelsheets, this is an excellent candidate.I would recommend you to seriously consider this power beast set for any purpose.

  1. Awesome battery backup of 6000MAh, it is the biggest advantage for an average user, it lasts two days in a single full charge.2. Very smooth processing power, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi, works like a flash.3. Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.4. 64MP main camera is excellent, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.5. If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.6. No problem of overheating while usage or charging.  Only con is 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, hope to see better charger with next version of the phone.

The phone is very impressive in terms of looks.4. The battery is 6000mah which means you can stop worrying about the battery to drain fast.I bought this phone on the launch date 5 march and amazon delivered it within 24 hours.The 64MP camera works really good even in low light,This phone also boasts a 32 MP front camera making video calls super clear.Dolby atoms makes listening to songs and music very good experience.As far as screen is concerned super Amoled display with pixel density of 443 is best in class.I've been using the phone for about 4 days now and the phone works smoothly.The fingerprint sensor is fast.No heating problems detected so far PUBG works seamlessly in the ultra HD mode.I charged the phone to a 100% and then used the phone for about 45 min,to my surprise the battery was drained just to 1%.So my verdict on the phone-Battery life-10/10Camera-8/10Display-9/10Software-9/10Design-8/10Performance-8/10Value for money-10/10

  The phone is excellent in terms of battery, camera, display and many more. I am extremely pleased with it till now. The processor is not too good. I play only PES 2020 and the game is playable only in the lowest graphics which is disappointing, considering such a beautiful display the phone has. Otherwise, a beast. The battery goes on more than a day despite gaming, without gaming it last close to 2 days. So, a good phone overall.

  If your looking to use your phone in one hand,  then the display might be a little long and using the phone in one hand mode is not that satisfying.It doesn't have some of the features that the A51 has but it compensates for that with speed and smoothness. Delivers on seamless experience.Real value for money. Camera is pretty good. The display is beautiful. The battery is a monster too.

Great phone for non Ga(y)mers
",5,"

  This phone is really good in day to day tasks. But it's processing power is not that good, sometimes it overheats while playing heavy games such as call of duty mobile and pubg mobile. As for the camera quality the daylight photos are crystal clear but the night photos are a bit blurry if you have shaky hands. Battery will last 1.5 days more or less and 2 if there is no Ga(y)ming involved. Oh and this phone probably has the best screen under 20k I haven't seen the other phones but this one is an one of a kind. There are some other small features that makes the phone easy to use too, so over all 4.5 out of 5 because of over heating during gaming and the rest is ten out of ten.

Value for Money in this Range. Suggest Go for it without any doubt.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage.Good:- Display was good with Blue light filter.- Performance is good for now. No heating or lagging.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.- Mobile speakers sound is fine.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good.Not So Good:Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Have been using this phone for 3 days and must admit it has lived upto its nam,  truly a mega monster. The battery needs no introduction neither does the super amoled display ,what does need to be looked at is the speed of facial recognition and the processor.  If you are a heavy gamer then this phone is not for you ,if you are a student with media consumption then it is best for you . The exynos 9611 processor though a bit slower toh snapdragon counterparts in this range ,the 6GB Ram does the thing for you ,makes multi tasking smooth. Rest all things like speaker and signal strengths are excellent as well, overall it's a value for money product

  I have been using this phone since March. I had ordered it in the first sale itself. It has been a very enjoyable experience till now.Starting with the key feature, the front and rear both the cameras serve their purpose very neatly. The picture quality is very clear. The wide angle feature is really cool.The screen is also of the ideal size with a smooth touch experience.The interface is user friendly. It hasn't hanged once since I bought it.8 GB RAM and 128 GB Internal memory size are the star features of this phone.I am going to end my review with my favorite feature, the 6000 mAh battery. It actually is a very long lasting battery and it can undoubtedly go for days without charging, if used minimally.

  I was tempted to write a review a few weeks after I bought this phone. I have been MI phone before. With some research and my requirements I bought this. I'm not disaapointed.What is good about this phone? The camera is superb. The battery is superb. But what I like the most is the display. With MI phones in the same prize range, the display of Galaxy M31 is much much better.Cons:Less OS features. Many of the software features are found missing in this phone. For example, short cut for taking screen shot doesn't work as desired. Facial recognition is a tat slow.Overall: 4.5 out of 5

  It's a good economical phone. Its fast and responsive. Battery life, screen display and sound quality are good, better than Chinese phones in this price range. It's better than galaxy A31.

  This main 64MP with 8MP ultra wide camara is very good and super image quality,even the 5MP macro lens captures the tiny details of the image in a beautifully. Before I buy I don't even thing It will be this good quality for this price. And even I am very satisfied with finger Print sensor, finger print sensor's response is awesome. And the 6000 mah battery is beyond my expectation, I comes two days backup with one time full charge. I am surprised and happy with the 6.4inch ""Super AMOLED disply"" Overall this phone is more than worth for the given money. As I am using from past 2months , I am not facing any heating issues and hanging issues..

  Before m31 I have m30s  which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.

Quality of Text Display is Great relative to earlier android based phones
",5,"

  In its segment, this is overall a good phone from the point of view of various factors such as - response time, battery life, storage space, touch interface, display, camera, etc. The only negative from my personal perspective is its size that is large. However, just like with other similar phones, a large size is unavoidable for a better display of media (video, text, etc). I guess the future solution to this problem are phones that can be folded after which they easily fit into the pocket!

  It's a good phone. While switching from my previous phone - Nokia 6.1, I could say a little disappointed, considering the usability aspects - Single hand operation, Holding comforts etc.Before purchase this do evaluate Redmi 9 pro too. It's a close match.Pros :Fingerprint reader is good. Comparing with Redmi 9 pro in which sensor is embedded in lock button, I didn't experience a usability concern because of face unlock.Amazing displayCompettative spec at this price point for a flagshipGood battery lifeSamsung galaxy usability apps - Better than Android one experienceCons :Heavy and bulky in hand ( Larger display)Not looks premium like Nokia

Honest m31 user suggestion

  Mobile features justifies with its name that is mega monster.Pros.1. Battery life- as I'm using mobile from last 7 days it's battery life is beyond my expectations. I'm heavy user and battery running life is arround 48 hours.2. Camera- four different cameras works in very good manner. Picture quality is excellent. When i zoom the picture it don't make blurred pixels.Front camera is also doing it's duty strongly.Mobile with latest features are excellentFew of them are pop up screen, side button uses, good adoption of fingerprint sensor.And the best thing is its super amoled display makes this mobile very attractive.Cons.If i talk about mobile cons there is only one what i get is- facelock feature is not working as good as i expected.Rest choice is yours, but after using this mobile i have recommended my friends to buy this mobile, and give you suggestion the same.In it's price segment it's really mega monster.

M31 in a review
",5,"

  I did a lot of research before i bought this phone. 1.First of all, the battery life is absolutely amazing, a heavy user like me is not able to kill battery in a day.2. The camera quality is quite decent. Although expected more , but for this price range it is pretty gud.3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.4. The fingerprint scanner has absolutely no time lag. It is very well made.5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.Overall, for people who are looking for a decent gaming and daily use phone. This Samsung Galaxy M31 is my recommendation to you.

Would Not go wrong with this phone at this price

  It's good phone. Little heavy but given it has 6000 mh battery it's understandable. Once charged, you can easily go with light usage - calls, songs , movies, photography etc.Display is really good with rich colours thanks to AMOLED. Samsung is known for its display.Camera Quality is awesome since 64 MP and 32 MP front camera.Only thing is it has Exonys processor so not suitable for someone into gaming.But if you are looking for a slim phone, this is not the one.It's far better at this point than Samsung A31 etc. I would say.

Does not live up to its hype..however  a decent buy

  Things that this phone does not live up to its promise:1. Front camera quality is not good. Dosent feel like a 32 MP definitely. Don't forget to  turn off the beauty mode.2. The night mode amplifies  up things artificially3. The main camera does not live upto the 64 mp hype- 48 MP cameras of other phones may be better. However for the price the macro, background blur effect and daylight photos are good.The operating system with the android  10 is good, screen quality is super, built is nice, fingerprint  sensor  very responsive,  no lags, decent sound quality, super battery.

  The finger print reader lacks a bit in the reading and is a bit clumsy. Maybe more functions like M30 could be added with the finger print reader over here as well. The camera is a bomb with amazing clarity in all aspects. After all its Samsung, the cameras are always amazing. The battery life if you say is 23 hours maximum with all possible activities, videos, games, calling, video calling , zoom meetings and if the net is not used, then the battery backup stays for as good as 30+ hours. A great WFM phone, amazing features. Maybe, there could be a system update for lagging a bit even after having 6GB RAM for keyboard application. But rest all, is amazing.

  For office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don't use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with ""Dolby Atmos"" effect on, which I didn't expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.

  1-The Galaxy M family has now transformed into a much bigger lineup and garnered a lot of attention,2-It offers very good battery life dats long for a 2 & half day backup..3-Scrolling through One UI 2.0 was smooth and apps were quick to open as well. Throughout our week-long usage, we did not encounter any slowdown or lags while using different day-to-day apps for messaging, social media browsing and so on. 4-it does manage to click shots that are generally pleasing to the eye and come out with rich colour and enough detail, its just possible because of wide angle and monster 64 cam..5-In the real world, this ultra-wide lens adds an all-new way to look at frames and click pictures fitting in more space than you would be able to use a standard smartphone camera.6- fingerprint sensor captures impulse on d go .. Backcover is very shiny carbonate piece making it light weight .....Excellent monster features on d goooo!!!!!

  Camera quality is very good but at the low light front and back camera performance are not good...Display is amezing...Battery is good but its charging time is very bad....(0% to 100% charging time = 2:30+ hours)....(work 1.2 or 1.5 days at normal uses)Fingerprint work fast but sometime it's not work... you need to clean your hand and then try...This phone is not for a gamers ...This is for a normal user...I am a normal user... and i write this review after 50 days of use....Otherwish this phone is the best phone for Samsung Lover....If you not a gamer and need a good phone for normal uses thn try it 😊

  Overall the mobile is good but the speed of internet is not good, I do not know but it's internet speed shows 3G not 4 G and most interesting thing is that the mobile also have LTE/3G connections only. But in my earlier mobile it was written as Vol LTE/4G etc. And I have continuously getting sms from my net provider that though they are giving 4G speed I am using 3G and asking me to convert my connection from 3G to 4G. I never thought at this much price Samsung selling only 3G mobile!!!!!!Some website I could not open after taking this mobile, whien I unfderstand the problem the time to return the mobile set has lapsed.

  Loved the phone.THE BEST DEAL IN ₹16000 FOR NORMAL PERSON.Pros-Massive battery.Descent Camera (NOT THE BEST BUT NOT BAD AT ALL).Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast.Processor is not the best but still a better one.No heating issues -Played Pubg(HDR, ULTRA), Clash of clanCons-Charging is really slow.Face unlocking is not at all fast.Missing that 8gb ram with 128gb variant.

Excellent touch feel.3. Camera quality is great.4. Battery life is around 48 hours.5. Finger print reader is good.As such there is no noticeable demerits in M31 but little dissatisfied with charging time and charger and pr9cessing speed of mobile1. Battery charging takes too much time.2. Charging cord is too small.3. Charger looks to be substandard compare to the charger i received with S8 and S9.4. Processor Speed is slow.

M31 Review after 1 week

  I have given 3 photos- 1 of front camera,1 of normal camera and 1 of macro camera. Camera is superb in daylight condition but side of the photo get distorted when wide angle camera is on. And camera doesn't perform well in low light condition. Battery life is good. It almost run 18 hours with full charge in full working condition all the time. And it also charges up quickly.Display is awesome. Any photo looks more attractive in this mobile tham other one. It's slim too and not so over weighed.Speaker is so loud and when you connect it with any sound system it gives whooping sound.

Justifies it's tag of MEGA MONSTER.

  The ultimate phone to have in the M series of Samsung.As I have already been a user of M30s, I can very accurately describe I went for M31.Besides the usual camera upgradation from 48MP to 64 MP (rear) and 16MP to 32MP (front) , I find M31 simply more responsive and compatible under my fingers. Besides a 6GB internal system storage and Android 10 OS gives you the feeling of a powerful machine in your hand.Plus you get the whole package of 6000mAh Battery, 6.4 super amoled display and cool design that gives you the feeling of a premium smart-phone.Well in nutshell, I can say this phone is a serious winner under the category of budget phone with all premium specifics and a sure thing to hang on to once you buy it.Happy to buy it from Amazon, super-fast, hassle free delivery.Word of Advice- Also buy a protective display glass and back cover to give your phone an ever-lasting long life.

  Yesterday I got stucked when I was using keyboard..I have to restart the mobile...anyhow after this I didn't get any problem.Front camera is not much butter as compare to other mobile 32 mega pixel comera.The image getting blured when zooming  the image.Rear camera is good.All sensors are working as expected.Some features must be implement which I didn't find in this mobile like -1. Internet speed status bar on the top of the screen.2. Daily data usage should be visible inside the top scroll bar It will help the user to limit the daily data use otherwise he went to know only when he spend 50% or 90% through sim card notification.Battery life is good and we are able user it more longer time as compare to other mobiles.I love the screen quality of this mobile.I got some new features in this mobile which are really  very helpful. Thanks Samsung!!!!!!

Big battery, Exceptional Cameras and Superb Display
",4,"

  The phone is absolutely amazing!!! I have bought it myself on the very first day of the sale, and by my usage of about 9 to 10 days, the phone is absolutely killer. Although it's not aimed for gamers in mind, the m31 still pulls off games with great ease and no lag. Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras. The hashtag used by Samsung #MegaMonster is truly apt for this phone.

  Good phone. Nice to use. Good battery life.  Only very minor hiccup is sometimes when it goes to lock and when I try to unlock it will not open the home screen. I need to restart to to make it work again. I think this started happening with one of the recent updates. Other than that I can see this phone worthy for money.2nd update :Now the lock issue with restart is rectified. It is not happening now.Fingerprint sensor is pretty decent. When compared to my previous phone moto G5S fingerprint was bit slow. But not too lag. It's good.

  I bought this one after reading too many reviews on Amazon and Google. I just got this delivered by today. Cover was good but the phone inside the box was having some of dust like the box has been opened once.Pros:Great phone to have under 20k. Great battery life,  good camera quality.Cons: charger is not faster enough to charge. It should have been better.When I searched all the reviews I neglected the charger reviews.  But after using it I also find this problem of slow charger.If u still want to buy this one u can replace the charger with the faster one.Phone is actually great.

  In love with Super amoled screen, it's just exponentially enhanced my captured photos and videos ,it also adds another level to my gameplying and videoplaying.The 64 megapixel camera provides you all the details you want but I'm actually fan of its wide angle lens ,its just superb.The ONE UI is always userfriendly yet with surprises and the last but ofcourse not the least BATTERY, oh that is literally a monster and I take the monstrous advantage of this during this lockdown. A very very very heavy usage needed to drain its battery in one day.Monster performance ,good biometrics (both fp and fd) and a beautiful yet lightweight design makes this phone a worth buying at this price. Love it.

  Phone is a steal at current price, giving best specs in the range and lots of features.  Samsung has really worked and delivered a product which exceeds market expectations.Samsung has done amazing job on the latest One UI. It is more intuitive and fast. Also, it works very well with all sorts of apps.Of course, the camera is exceptional,  especially its  64MP mode which has good detailing.The display also looks excellent as it's super amoled which was only available in higher end models until now.Holding and using the phone is also very easy due to sleek design and less weight even with the mega battery. The battery backup is amazing,  giving me 2 days battery life on single charge with good usage.Definitely worth every rupee.

I'll rate 5/5.Battery : Battery is also exceptionally well that lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage. 5/5Processor : Till now it is running very smooth. seeing no lag so again will give 5/5.UI: Samsung provides customer friendly User Interface. Face unlock works little bit slow but fingerprint sensor is very fast. 4.5/5Earlier I was using redmi note 6 pro but I found so many issues specially GUI and device hang, I decided to switch to samsung and till now I am pretty much satisfied with it.

  I have been using M31 from March. And ordered another 1 a week ago for a friend.Handset is truly the best in performance.Battery lasts for a day under heavy usage.12 hrs of actively used hotspot will only cost 25% of the battery.6 gigs of RAM is enough to hold several running application to do multitasking.I really like Text editing mode in keyboard, which you don't even find in iPhones.Game booster is gem when you need extra juice for heavy games.Watching videos on Super AMOLED display is good experience.In PiP mode you can watch videos while doing other tasks.Go for it.

Good specs in the given price
",5,"

  Galaxy M31's camera sure lives up to my expectations. The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3. Overall it's a good purchase within given price, especially if you're a camera fanatic.

  Highly satisfied with the looks of this phone..... camera is great but still trying to figure out what to do with macro mode.... performance is a bit compromising but still can't say it's bad in this price..... previously I was using Samsung M30 which had 5000mah battery but in that Battery lasted more than in this device.... would highly recommend to try this phone.....It can actually be called upgraded version of M30.....😚 I like it because of its display, camera and looks.... performance could have been more efficient but still it's good enough for daily use and gaming also. It has letest version of Android so hopefully it'll get newer versions of Android sooner in comparison of other devices running on older versions of Android.....In M30 also got upgraded versions quickly

  It is an amazing phone which I had ever seen within a low budget. I brought this phone at the beginning of its launch. After using more than 6months, I found a few pros of this phone is:1. Battery Life (The Best Feature)2. Camera Quality3. Sound Quality4. Less Price5. Fast Charger6. Fingerprint ReaderI could not find any cons as of now but would suggest to #Samsung that guys if you could make it slimmer like your 'A' series then that would be more attractive.All I can say if you want to buy a low budget phone along with more features and good battery life then the Samsung M31 is a perfect choice.

The battery lasts me more than a day and that I am almost all day with the hooked because I work with him. I love unlocking with the finger, it recognizes the fingerprint at the moment and it takes less time than if I have to put the code or with facial recognition, which as with a mask or glasses does not recognize me because in the end you have to put the code to unlock.

Samsung Galaxy M31 review - Impressive
",4,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31 - writing a review after 3 days of use. Mobile feels good in hand. Display and design is good. I was skeptical earlier about the weight of the mobile...but it is pretty slim and good to hold. You won't notice the weight.Display is bright...makes it easier to read, pics look good. Performance is impressive...apps load faster...multi tasking is good. The mobile doesn't hang. Best part so far is it didn't heat under moderate to heavy usage.Mobile camera is pretty decent both selfie and main camera. Night mode pics are good too...The biggest advantage is the battery. Single charge came for almost three days.This is it for now.Overall impressed with it.

  Fingerprint sensor is good, nothing to worry about. But the phone battery is of 6000mAh and it goes as long as my other phone which is of 4000mAh. Camera is quite awesome, it has supernice features. Though, I am not a selfie lover so front camera works okay with me but if you are selfie lover then, you may feel a little dissatisfied. It's not bad or horrible, but not the best too, especially in bad lighting.Overall, I am having a nice experience.One additional point, the back cover is plastic and it seems cheap. I think atleast they can give us customer,  a metal fee, like MI phones.Touch is smooth. Overall it's a good phone.

Worthy phone considering cost. Few feature additions could make Samsung invincible.
",5,"

  Everything about the phone is good except gaming experience. Camera seems to be a decent one though haven't used it much. Sometimes fingerprint reader seems unresponsive. However a worthy budget phone.Xiaomi Motorola offering 30W Charger and better processor/GPU in similar cost which I think  Samsung should really think upon.One of the feature which gives premium look to the device is Always On Display. One UI is better then others customized Andriods, however adding an option to customize the launcher would be a another great addition, I believe Stock Andriod launcher is the best, giving an option for vertical drawer will make UI complete.

  I bought this phone for 3 reasons:- Awesome Screen- 2 Days Battery Life Yet Easy To Carry- Great Camera PerformanceI am happy to say that Samsung M31 delivers on all the above promises.What could have been better:- Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.- Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity.I think it would be too much to ask for anything else from a device this good at such an amazing price point.In short, if you want a device with an awesome screen, huge battery life and amazing camera - just go for the MegaMonster Samsung M31.

  Product is very good and best in look too. Battery is OK as it is a 6000mah battery, if you use for a whole day it will drain quickly. Camera is very good. Processor and its performance is just OK as the mobile stuck for a second some time. Finger print scanner some time not working for a second or two. Price is little bit more as compared to its specification.Best phone if you dont want to buy a Chinese brand.

  I got the delivery of phone on 6 March.When you first boot up the phone you will get update for February security patch.This phone comes with One Ui 2.0 & the first best part of is you can delete preloaded apps. This ui is more snappy & feels like a premium phone even though it's a midrange phone.Pros :-1) Super amoled display with L1 certification2) UI is more responsive & can be customizable as per our need which basically give a feel of stock android.3) Battery Backup is killer you can do the excessive task on this phone.4)Ram Management is on point.Cons :-1) Photos of night atmosphere are not good.2) Speaker of the phone is ok.3) Placement of headphone Jack.4) Slow Charging speed & length of the USB cable is too short.Though, Samsung gives good package of software's like Dolby atmos, MrOwl for unlimited cloud storage.

After using the mobile for one month
",4,"

  I bought the mobile on March and have been using for the past 3 months.. I am a tehnological addict who would keep on changing mobile once in 6 months... Previously I was using Oppo F11 and  being unsatisfied with the specs of that model, I bought this device.. I am extremely happy about this device as the phone is really superb and an excellent choice for normal and heavy usage.. Battery back up is massive and no need to worry even if you play heavy graphics games and You don't need to carry a power bank or charger even if you happen to halt in a place for 2 days .. Display and Camera quality are awesome and comparatively better than other mobiles at this price segment.. My friend is using iPhone 7 plus and he is asking my m31 as exchange to his iPhone...I really love the Pixel and display clarity.. You can blindly buy the mobile without any negative thought...

  Nothing Good in it , I buy it before half and month, in first 10 days its touch not working and replace by amazon and after  one and half month its display gone, all blackout and after visiting customer care, they told me, repair could not done in warranty, you have pay for repair/replacement of display. after arguing with customer care at least they agree to email the phone pic to company technician and they told me to contact in two days, after two still there is no answer about my phone. In whole this process the didn't collect my phone and still damage phone is with me .So I suggest anyone to don't by Samsung Mobile phone

  It takes approx 3 hours to fully charge the phone from 0 to 100%. Battery life survives for single day only. Camera quality is not awesome. Overall quality is good when you have Spigen back cover. Also never use tempered glass when you have Gorilla glass in your phone. I am using Samsung products since 12 years.

Best quality phone. Perfect choice
",1,"

  Usually I agonise a lot of picking a phone, and after hours and hours of research I chose this one. And I am not disappointed. The build quality is excellent, you can tell by its weight. The battery life surprised me. I use my phone constantly, watching videos and for video calls and it lasts me the whole day!. The camera is a little warm toned and pretty good. Sometimes I do doubt it's quality though. It's a little finicky at times. Audio and everything is good. It doesn't hang at all. Good phone.

  Very nice phone..I am giving review of this phone after using more then 2 months. Camera quality is very good, battery life is very good, super amoled screen gives smooth experience till now there is no problem in touch and functionality even after playing games for hours. Samsung is good brand name and hardware quality is also good. This phone is having 6000mah battery which makes itself a powerbank, so guys charging tooks little k more time then other fast changing phones in market.

THE SUPERPHONE ( Mega Monster)
",4,"

  I think it is the best phone under 15000/- .Fingerprint sensor is fast and there is no issue about it. Camera quality is superb but i think if the camera's aperture were 1.7 then it will destroy every other company's smartphone in camera segment though it has very nice capacity to take very good pictures. The pics taken by it still so awesome. Atlast the battery life is very good. If someone wants to increase the battery life then they can use some tricks like blocking wifi scanning, blocking nearby device scanning , blocking bluetooth scanning,  using, dark mode, blocking unwanted notifications from the apps, using power saver mode, ultra data saver mode, and data saver mode. Then battery performance will be raise to the extreme.

  It's a real mega monster specially  in  this  price  range. I liked m31 very much because of its 64 mp quad camera 4k video recording ,the super amoled  FHD+infinity  u display with a big screen size of 6.4 inch also the fast charging  and long lasting  6000mAh battery ,and a good processor and a very quick working  face lock and fingerprint sensor, it is a product which is worth for the amount taken and it is the second time I bought it .An excellent value for money product

Samsung M31 is a excellent phone

  I m using Samsung for first time to support made in India and non Chinese phone. But astonished to see the quality which is marvelous. Super amoled screen is mind blowing. Camera is very good. Macro camera is also nice. Video calling experience is superb with 32 mp front camera. Sound is vibrant. Liked the quality very much. Watched 4k videos which is flawless. If anyone think to purchase then no second thought required. But cons is that a little costly. However after using I didn't regret its price.

Don't think twice if you stumble upon M31, because it's best.

  Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.

  I m using it for nearly 1 month and till now there are no issues in the ram i.e the phone doenot lag atall but the issue is of the weight.. still it can be ignored as one gets used to it but the massive battery is the cause of the weight .... the mobile is good at this price as comes with quadcamera and the night pictures are awesome camera is good but no fingerprint shutter click feature is there..the product satisfied me and i m really glad to spend 17000 for this product..

  Display quality is awesome, Camera is good in this price range, storage and copy paste time is completely fine, Fingerprint reader is quick but not scan efficiently sometime, built quality  is cheapest I'd say, I got scratch on the screen on the second day and the back is worst plastic ever but the interesting thing is it perform very well, it'll do normal usage and perform decent on gaming and honestly battery doesn't feel like 6000 mah it perform as 4000 mah battery, overall you'll not regret about buying this phone but you must buy a good quality or premium back cover to protect and make it look good.

SAMSUNG M31 Beast
",4,"

  This is a true Samsung beast.And this is the best phone you can expect with this features at this price range.The fingerprint reader is lightning fast, but Samsung has to improve the face recognition as take a bit time even with 6GB of ram.And now the camera, no doubt about it. It's a massive 64mp main camera. It can shoot videos in 4k resolution.If you are a heavy user the battery is going to last a whole day. And for mid range user it lasts for about one and half to two days.And it is great to note that this phone operates on one ui 2.0 which is very user friendly.If you find this helpful give a thumbs up.

  I was facing some long booting problem after I turn on my Samsung M31 device. But when I go to device care and there was a notification that my restarting process wasn't normal and then there was ""send report"" button. So, I sent and I guess with that I got a software update after some days. Then after I updated, my problem is gone and working very smoothly as always. With samsung, I love the most is there daily health monitoring like how many steps, run, and lost calorie etc. With it I could keep my health on track. Battery life is moderately good and the macro, wide angle,  night cameras are awesome. I would suggest Samsung are doing best with very affordably.

  It has a decent camera with numerous features...........night mode is not very good it is just ok. But other features of camera do not let you feel the shortcoming of night mode.Performance vise, it is good with fast speed and doesn't lag due to it's big ram. This phone doesn't provide bixby as A series doSetting and notification panel provide many features  for great experience.Biometrics is good...........1 out of 8 times fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize you but works good even with wet hands.......face lock is also decent.The features that stand out from all of these are........its screen with amoled display is simply treat to our eyes, battery charger could be more fast but still it is good, performance and classiness.................if your budget is around 15 to 16k then you can definitely look upto this mobile

  There is a fake rumour which is spread by youtubers and reviewers in d market.There is this notion that it EXYNOS 9611 is laggy, wifi reception is not good, battery is not 6000, camera quality  is better than MI note 8 pro...etc..But it's not.Camera's image processing  is lot more efficient than the 8 pro's MEDIATEK HELIO G90T which is d most powerful  processor. Night images are also good.Wifi and cellular network reception is also as better than expected. It may show one or two bars less but there is no compromise in the call quality.Personally  I like the phone very much. SUPER AMOLED, Always On Display is the centre of attraction.

  Samsung M31 is the best in terms of value. It has good battery life. If you don't have use of games then it's battery life is 2 days or more. It's 6,128 version is best of all. Camera quality is good in terms of true color. Their is no difference between 48MP Camera and 64MP of M31. Selfie front Camera 32MP is not that bad as primary one.

  The product is wisely good to use daily tasks run smoothly.. app transitions were smooth . No stuttering or legs.  Display takes it all..crisp and clear with viewing angles...too good.

One ui is decent way better than touchwiz. Bloatware can be removed or disabled. Over all good phone from Samsung gives tight competition to other phones in the same price bracket. Monster battery the name says it all..more than one day or close to 2 days it can last.. gaming is smooth with lil frame drops..

MY FIRST SMARTPHONE IN MY LIFE

  Firstly, I am very glad to inform you that ""Samsung M31"" is the first smart phone in my life. Currently I am using feature phone 'Samsung Guru 1200' which was purchased around 5 years ago. When I decided to go for a smart phone, it didn’t need to think much about which brand I would choose. I Zen percent believe that I made the best choice. Because I am already well experienced about the quality, battery life etc... of the Samsung company. I got my phone last week, but I didn't started to use it yet because of its cuteness. Thank you Samsung for presenting such a best phone satisfying all features at affordable price for a middle class person like me. Thank you so much….

Awesome Mobile !!!

  Such a wonderful mobile. Just received yesterday. I am very happy with this product. First of all after reading negative review I was very much confused whether to buy or not. But I ordered as because of the brand and various specifications like 6000mah battery, SAmoled display, 64 mp camera and so on.But after using the product I am fully satisfied. So don't go with negative reviews. My honest request to everyone...... Just go for it without any doubt. I got it with 1500/- discount extra using my credit card. I am having 6gb RAM with 128internal memory.👍👍👍👍👍Just awesome, fabulous, marvelous, premium feeling 😎😎😎

  Excellent  phone performance, speed and battery life. I was using one plus 6 and after procuring samsung m31 its really best phone on the price. Also the speed and clarity of speech is also excellent. Performance is also very good in terms of speed. Also major advantage  is battery life and also phone is not heating after continuous  use. Excellent  product

  Initial product review - 1. the battery easily lasts for a day with mobile data on for the most part.2. The 64 MP main camera produces amazing pictures with good balance3. The new processor works buttery smooth with multiple apps running simultaneously. 4. Also a type C otg adapter would have been appreciated5. I would have loved to see Samsung release a matte black version of the phone, but the glossy ""space black"" still looks pretty good

Samsung M31, really great value for money..., A Monsterous Smart Phone.
",4,"

  Samsung M31 is really gave me great satisfaction. It's sleek design is very nice. Fingerprint reader functions nicely. Camera quality is also great, however I have not experienced it's full feature, but 64MP camera really gives real type feeling. The only very slight minus point is Battery life. But, I think due to multiple app function, GPS etc, it's battery is slightly less powerful. But, you can go for full day in single charging. Charging is also fast. In a nutshell Samsung M31 is really value for money and it's features are really Monsterous .......😊😊😊

Samsung  processors for this mid ranger is good using thing phone for a Week or more and battery is amazing the Massive 6000 mAh gets you going for 2 days also full charging  takes 1 and half hour but even on 50%of battery can go full day. Camera is Good but haven't tested it full but clicked some pic in night conditions got pretty well image. If your gamer and don't want to spend money above 20K you can go for this without  any doubt

  Amazing phone, I am not much into heaving gaming, I usually watch movies n take random pics, is perfect for my usage.  Coming to camera its damn good n best thing for me is it takes natural color pics.....not too much boosted colors. And the display is super AMOLED  screen, best for a movie experience. Software experience is too good and smooth too....no lags.....Battery is the king here. Easily lasts 1½ day. If u use less than average might last for 2 days too...... just go for it If u r not into too much of gaming.Amazon delivery was good no issues

  If display and battery is what you demand from your phone with a pretty decent camera you can go for Samsung M31. If you are into lot of games and stuffs and you go on for hours playing PUBG and other heavy games then this device might be a nightmare for you. Personally my opinion is to opt for a Samsung phone always instead of Chinese smartphones because of smooth UI experience and less bloatwares.The crisp sAmoled display will let you stare at it the whole day and still consume less battery and eyesight. Don't research just go for a Samsung phone straight away.

  I like the smoothness on the phone, it's camera is really good, the zoom allows the picture not to get pixelated even if you zoom in a lot. The fingerprint gesture and the face recognition is quite fast in comparison to other phones. Battery life is good. However,  the phone gets heated up at times and becomes difficult to take a call and placing on the ear when it's heated up. Also, the phone automatically restarts in between, maybe once every 3-4 days. Overall, this is a good phone for this price!

Samsung Galaxy M31 6/64- 30 days usage review
",4,"

  The Samsung M31 is an amazing piece and value for money. The 6gb RAM, sAMOLED screen make a great combination when operating the phone, gives you a smooth and premium feel. The camera quality is mind blowing, it gives you crisp and clear images with high quality and less size and is one thing that is always expected in a Samsung phone. Battery Life is worth the hype of 6000mAh and easily lasts the entire day of 12-15 hours of usage. The phone does heat up on playing games such as CoDm and PUBG and the battery drains quickly too.  But, if you are looking for a non Chinese phone with excellent specs and decent gaming just go for this one!

  Before i bought this product I've checked a lot of reviews and as everyone said it's good for people who consume a lot of media i went ahead and bought this.. This phones got one of the best displays in this price segment.. it's an awesome experience to watch movies and shows in this phone. And with the amazing battery backup of 6000mah we can watch shows continuosly for hours. The camera quality is also really awesome. I love everything about this phone except the charging speed.. it takes me around 3 hours to fully charge. I wish they would have added a much more faster charger instead of that 15W. Also sometimes the face unlock is bit slow or unresponsive. But as a whole i absolutely love this product.

  I've been using this phone for 2 months now. Here are some pros and cons.Pros:1. Excellent screen, you will get that ultra HD feel with this amoled display.2. Long battery life, as I'm an average user battery stands for 1.5 day easily.3. Price is fair enough and it's without any adjunk. And also safer than chinese phones.Cons.1. Signal reception may be weak sometimes,  manier times it happens that you receive less signal and internet connectivity is lost.2. Fingerprint reader sometimes not recognizing and delays have to touch several times, I don't know if this is only with me or with others too.

  Why are some of the reviews mentioning poor camera etc? There is nothing much wrong with this phone. It is a good product and should be a smooth companion for an year at least.P.S> I don't play games on my phone. I wanted a great display (AMOLED), decent performance, good camera and a reasonably decent battery life. I got what I wanted and if you want the same, go for it too. Do buy a good case along with the phone because Samsung has not given a case inside the box.

  Using my M31 since about a week and so far an AMAZING experience. Certainly stands out as a MONSTER product. In last 5 days had to put to charge only twice, and do mind that my usage is not that bad as need to attend office meetings/calls which rarely finish in time.😀., use Facebook and WhatsApp very frequently.So battery life gets full Marks, once fully charged you can forget about charging for at least a day and a half. Front and Rear Camera quality is superb. Fingerprint sensor works fine but I would advise to use the phone with a back cover.

Dont even waste time to review features of other phones. Also , the main thing : Samsung is a NON CHINESE COMPANY.  That's another biggest factor for me.

  Great mid range phone from Samsung. The 6000 mAh battery does speaks a lot about the battery performance. The biometric unlocking works pretty well. The 8GB RAM support and the 128 GB memory is good in this price segment, so far I haven't experienced any lag issues. The quad rear camera and the front camera of the Samsung M31 captures some good shots although there are some issues during the the low light especially with the front camera. You would probably enjoy using the Bixby vision and the Live Focus feature of the camera. The Super AMOLED FHD+ display does gives you awesome bright feel. Overall a good phone from Samsung.

  Looks - goodFit and feel - goodSound quality - goodScreen display - v.goodCamera both back and front - average to below average, does not live up to 64 MP or 32 MPVideo and picture quality is really really bad. Shot a video from about 10 feet distance. Quality was pathetic. I can say that the camera is bad in every sentence of my review.

M31 SAMSUNG REVIEW
",4,"

  Positive -After long time Samsung M series came up as per user requirement with budget cost.Having ample features in this cost.Good product M31 within 15000 cost.Negative-Observed problem in mouth  piece of micro phone so many of the time voice do not reach to other end and had to use speaker of the phone .there are multiple reviews also on this and many of the users faced this issue.Samsung should update the software if this can be fixed through that else this is very big drawback in M31.Some of the application hangs with this phone Google pay is one of them.

Best camera and touchscreen
",5,"

  The camera quality is really exciting with 64 MP quad camera capturing almost all details. The macro and wide angle options makes it outstanding for this price. However, sometimes when required to take fast actions, focus is being lost. Autofocus is not so quick as well.  32 MP front camera is a beast!!!The smoothness of display and screen is highly appreciable and commendable and this will be the best in this price range.Finger print reader should have been onscreen and the case could be ceramic or metalic which are being offered by other manufacturers for this price or lower.Eventhough it is claimed to be 6000 mAh, draining of battery is quick and you need to recharge once in a day.Unexpected crash of apps is also observed within one week of time.

It's a beast.

  It's been nearly 2 months  with gadget,  and still it works as  new. They said it's a monster  and it is. Its battery  life is so amazing. Even while playing pubg it last a long shot. Probably  better than any other phones I know about. I don't use the fingerprint  scanner  much but it is perfect. And if you are a gaming geek then its perfect for you. Its processor is great , you won't have to stop for a min.  What can I say about its cameraquality  .....64mp where do you get that ?  At last Samsung  has got my trust for life time. You will always find a Samsung  gadget  in my pocket. Thank you for your time. Just buy it!

  It's been a week since I bought the device and here are my opinions.1. Awesome battery life2. Great camera3. Amazing display4. Good performance5. Has a headphone jack 😀Improvements I want1. The chipset could have been better2. Implement better gpu for gaming3. If possible add an in display finger print scanner4. Video stabilization would be niceOverall it's a good device to buy if you are looking for non Chinese smartphone (even if you compare it with similar Chinese smartphones it is upto par). But for gaming I wouldn't recommend this device.

Overall good in this budget😄

  It is such a nice phone in this budget.I suggest u to buy this. Camera quality is awesome. And buy 128gb varient and black colour cuz difference is only rs1k. But there are some cons like the company dont provide charger and earphone. And the phone is too broad but it is not heavy😁.Choose  black colour cuz in blue colour, the scratches seen very easily. Battery life is good but the company should provide 18watt charger instead of 15watt for fast charging. It takes 2to 3 hr to charge and company should provide gorilla glass10 in this generation .  Btw display is great.It is a honest review🤪.Thanks

Its everything that the advertisement says!

  Considering how much it costed me and the brand I invested in , I very happily and confidently say that this phone is precisely everything that the advertisement say about it.  It's been 12 days since I bought this handset and so far I have never run out of battery. My son and I both, have been playing pubg for hours and though there are super minor glitches which one can easily ignore..this phone has been awesome. The camera and finger print sensors are super fine and quick.The phone appears more worth than its value to me.If you are planning to  buy a handset, go for M31 without even a single doubt in mind.

  Overall phone is fantastic loved to use. Battery life still needs few improvements. Any new phone automatically gives more battery life and lastimg reduces as phone age moves on. I expected my battery life to be lasting atleast 48 hrs given this is new phone and I dont use it heavily. Like I just use for 5-6 phone calls per day lasting 30 mins. And watsapp 2 hrs. Other apps amounting about 2 hrs.Apart from battery life everything seems perfectly fine till now. I have been using this phonelast week of May

  Previously I had used C9 Pro compared to that M31 was little bit fast and the battery backup was too good. Both front and back camera quality was superb. Im using this m31 mobile for more than a month and usage of mobile is high, like i would use mobile around 15 hrs in a day(most of time i use it for browsing) after that I will put the mobile in charging overnight (1 time in a day). While i put it on charge in day time i have observed it was getting charged to 15% to 100% with in 2hrs for a 6000 mah monstere battery. I'm really satisfied in battery backup side and camera side when compared to my previous mobile C9 Pro.  Really worth buying.

  I am using this device from last 20 hours.. My first impressions are as below.Display-Super Amoled. Best in class. You will love it.Camara-Rear camera performs  very well. No complaint.Front camera is not up to mark. But overall good quality.Processor - I am  not  heavy user.  It performs daily  tasks  very well.Fingerprint- Quite  fastNetwork Speed- very goodBattery- It gave me almost 4 hours screen time from 52% battery and 15% battery is still left. So it is excellent.Software- One Ui very best.. many customization options.Charging Speed- Not testedBuild Quality- You have to compromise with plastic back. But glossy finish looks premium.

  Wonderful phone, the screen has amazing contrast levels and produced vibrant colours even in bright sunlight and with a very good processor along 6GB of ram and 128 GB of storage, performance, launching apps and switching between them was quick, Battery life was excellent with 6000 mAh juice, 15W fast charger and with samsung’s One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 it feels good and camera has 64MP wide-angle camera, a 5MP depth camera, a 5MP macro lens and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens and live focus is asm and works great in low-light conditions, too and it has a 32MP front-facing camera with AR Emoji feature which is cool and its worth the money.

  First of all this is a samsung product, the specifications are as they are promised.Battery takes up to 1.5 hrs to charge which will not be a problem if you charge your phone overnight.Camera, i have come to the conclusion that it performs better in natural settings and mostly indoors too, but in low light it suffers a bit.Processor, for me it is sufficient i do a lot of multitasking sometimes games like call of duty etc. I experienced no lag as such.The screen is amazing, I mean come on it's samsung they provide one of the best screens out the there.Overall it's worth every penny and i got it at 17k.

  This phone is whooping chartbuster.  The Camera quality is outstanding and the custom OS is excellent. The phone has a quick reflex and the gaming is superb.  The camera has amazing abilities like Panorama,  ultra wide,  live focus etc.  The battery life is the next point, 6000mah is more than enough for an average human being.  Especially if you are a gamer,  a whooping 9 and half hour gaming is provided in this awesome phone. Fingerprint reader is also very fast and the face sensor is prompt. I recommend this phone to everyone as it is an overpowered phone for a nice budget.

  Hardware wise not a lot to complain about everything is great but can use some software touches like camera i think the software need an upgrade the pictures taken get soften too much and the details get compromised, the fingerprint reader is fast the Samoled looks great!. Stock android would have been great had to uninstall a lot of unnecessary applications otherwise UI is great and oh the battery life this baby could last ages long battery life one full charge and this will last all day even with heavy usages one con is the heating issues the cpu throttles a lot if u put it to work maybe because they dont use thermal paste and use some sort of padding to take the heat away from cpu which doesnt do its job efficiently

  Samsung M31 is a Best quality product having  the great performance and built quality is also good with the latest Android 10 That is available in chipest price.M31's comes with 64mp quad camera and 6.4 Amoled display are amazing.Camera comes with lots of modes likeSlow motion, super-slow-mo, live focus,  macro shot, night mode, ultra wide shot & many more filters. 3 stars to it's battery lifeBecause  while using phone it releasing  heat.Samsung  announced  that the new M31 will come with 6000mAh battery although the performance  is good but battery life is not satisfactory.In other hand i will say that it has the 6000 mAh battery  but the charger  is 15V that is not suitable  to charge a heavy battery.

  thumbs up for mid range phone.. M31 rocks in this price segment with its display quality and relatively better camera then others. the camera quality is much better than others wrt to clarity and details it preserve and photos doesn't seem to be over saturated and edited like other brands do. battery is beast and processor is good. only one drawback for all samsung phones that it stops giving software updates within a year or so and hence people who are genuinely concerned with security of the phone are in the back seat. overall good buy.

  Design not so good but sturdy, made in India, no lags works smoothly running multiple apps in the background.

Best mobile .....😘😘😘  Read comment carefully

  Guys its a really very good product... But my personal opinion is that instead of buying 6 64 you should buy 6 128. As most people says that front camera is not good but also its not to bad. Remember this mobile doesn't have private space for hidding photos and all. Also don't have app lock. One best thing in this mobile is that it has many more features than other mobiles. So you can blindly go for it. You can use your mobile continuously for more than 24 hrs without charging full nonstop. Best thing of this mobile is its display and keyboard . Keyboard is very sensitive . Also mobile values best for the price.

  Thanks to Prime day sale I got this phone at ₹15000. I am using this phone for 7 days, so far it is a good phone. 6000mAh Battery, AMOLED Display and 64MP Camera is excellent at this price. If you want to use this phone specially for playing PUBG then, don't buy this phone. I found there is occasionally frame drop while playing at smooth and ultra settings. For media content, camera and Battery life this phone is awesome. The new ONE UI I found no lags until now I hope this smoothness will continue for 1 or 2 more years, not like older samsung phone with experience ui.

  First sight-impressive. Beautiful design with camera and speaker placed at appropriate  positions (big square camera placed right at the back of the phone takes away that stylish look- and which is not so with samsung m31). The battery life is too awesome; including camera, audio and video quality (battery may outlive me). The overall performance of the cell is excellent. If you are not a big time gamer in want of high speed phones, this phone is highly recommended. This phone performs slightly at low speed for some games as compared to other phones under similar budget.

  First of all this is an amazing budget phone from samsung. I think for this rate m31 is an extraordinary phone. The camera is very good in condition and also 64mp camera is amazing. The battery performance is just unbelievable its lastlong even while playing pubg. Also we can play pubg and codwithout any lag or anykind of thing that affect the gameplay. The SAMOLED display is giving us a great playback feature. The speakers has also a great and enriched sound. One thing should be said that is the great DOLBY ATMOS its just rocking. After all that its a massive phone in this budget of 18k. Review after 1 month use.

  As a proud owner of Samsung Galaxy M31, I wish to say this is the best phone I’ve ever had. It’s a high end phone with ‘total value for money’.Compared to other phones in the same price range, it has the best features, especially the camera, 64 MP photos look really good ; it also has macro mode to take close pictures of small objects and it has a wide angle camera too, which can take photos with a large field of view.It has loads of features and One UI is very customisable.Well done Samsung !!

  I had a Galaxy J7 back in 2016. After switching over to the M31 from the Motorola G5s, the display simply blew me away. the colors are really vivid, and you really enjoy watching content on this device. another huge aspect that was important for me was the battery. 6000 mah is no joke and Samsung has done an excellent job of putting this in a package without driving the prices up. one big difference switching from the G5s was the size and weight but I got used to it within a couple of dates. The quality of the product is really impressive, I recommend it wholeheartedly.

If you are good at mobile photography,then change the settings to your choice and proceed, the you will love it.The quality of outcome is great in good lighting.  The only Cons I'm facing is it takes some extra time for charging.Other than that the phone is the best in this budget.

  Well waited for almost a month for 8GB Ram & 128GB Storage version of M31 and I must tell you patience simply paid off. It is one of the best mobiles I have used to date. The battery lasts for almost 1.5 days after full charge with moderate usage. The camera is awesome only low light clicks are a little problematic. RAM performance is top-notch. Switching between apps, fingerprint scanner are quick to respond. Face unlock takes about 2 - 3 seconds. But all the cons mentioned above can be neglected. Overall it is a total package for a person looking to buy mid-budget phones. Must buy as per my personal experience.

  Fingerprint reader - it designed very well that you can't even feel it by touching it. When I touches it feel like I am touching the phone's back not the fingerprint. And it's very fast.Battery life - you will get a very good battery. On heavy uses it backups for 1 and a1/2 day. Fast charging available.Camera - great. I have a great experience with the camera.Display - it's not expected to have a display like this in this price range. It feels so good that's why I didn't applied any glass protection.Gaming experience is also good.Go for it.Good work Samsung.

  The fingerprint reader is optimum and good.The battery life of the phone is truly monstrous and the camera quality as we all know Samsung had always been a winner.The only  problem which a peson may  face is that the data cable is short in length .Also the company could  also provide a case/cover as the phone is having a plastic back.That's all from my side and also it's a great alternative  for Chinese brands and as we all know that Samsung has a great network all over the country so, no problem will be faced when someone is searching for servicing.

Premium phone for a great price
",5,"

  Premium phone for a great price. Simple to operate .It has a 600mAh battery that lasts 2 days of normal use, it is a very large battery so the charge takes about 3h but thanks to the fast charge it takes much less.Camera: I was very pleasantly surprised, the image quality is really good for both cameras. You can configure the blur effect to give a more professional look and there are several modes to adapt to any photographic situation: panoramic, burst, professional, slow motion ... the ones I liked the most are the macro that takes photos with a lot of detail

  Samsung Galaxy M31 is a value for money product with best specifications in its variant and price range so far. I am using 6gb+128gb space black version and it's working perfectly. Some people have posted reviews stating that there are network issues with the handset but I didn't encounter any problems. I highly recommend this phone in its price range. It's a phone packed with all features and the battery life is superb. Also with the fast charging the phone charges from 20% to 100% in approx 80 mins

  Well no doubt indeed it was one of the most awaited mobile phone of 2020 and I must say It was worth it ,6000 mah battery , 64mp camera and many more cool and latest featuresBut there was one minute areas where I believe the creature should have taken care of  - length of data cableNo doubt the charger is a fast charger still it would have been appropriate if the length of cable was bit longerLast but not the least as a Samsung user I never get tired of bragging the level of service you provide us at your service centre ..pls keep it like this always🧡

  6000 mAh  battery  . 32MP  front  camera. 64MP+8MP+5MP+5MP  rear  camera .Also  has  samsung  latest  ui  .  and  6  gb  ram  ,128  gb  storage.  In  16000 rupees ,  you  can't  ask  for  more.  Really , I  like  Samsung galaxy M31 . If  you  are  looking mobile for  watching  series  and  movies , Samsung galaxy M31 is  nice  . If  you  are  looking  for  gaming , Samsung galaxy M31 is  good, although  you  may  look  for  another  smartphones because Snapdragon is better  than Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 in  some  points. In  comparision  with  other  samsung  smartphones ,Samsung galaxy M31 has  one  disadvantage  that  Samsung galaxy M31 has  front  gorilla glass  3  and  no  rear  glass  while  some  samsung  phones  have  rear  glass.

  Phone is worth at this price range. Comparing to the phone i have used before like Nokia, the cameras of Samsung galaxy M31 is missing details in the pictures, but is good in low light. Overall the the cameras are really good compared to other Samsung phones in this price range. I love the full black body, when the phone is used in dark screen mode, it absolutely a great feel of having very nice gadget at hand - Hats off to the design here. Ofcourse, the display is superb. And battery life is really a plus on this phone. A great product to own! Though, the charger i recieved in the box is defective, its not working, i had to use my other chargers to charge my phone because i didn't like to exchange my phone just for the defective charger.

  Need to improve in camera quality, though the camera is 64 mp but picture quality is not that much good as 64mp or 32mp, front camera picture is little bit hazy,  overall performence is good but need to work on picture quality  of front & back camera, battry is good , if you use the phone with heavy apps & browsing all the time in a day you can get the battery backup one day after full change but not more than that.

  The product is quite satisfying. The picture quality is better. The phone charges quickly that saves my time. Overall I love my M31 mobile. Also I have some issues the picture quality is not upto the level I excepted. Also the upper part of the phone's screen gets much heated when I put them on charging. After some times it gets cool automatically. When the phone was delivered since then the phone was heating. If possible kindly settle the issue as soon as possible and try giving me the reason behind the heating of mobile Rather than that there is no other issues.

  This new Samsung beast is monster in every aspect i.e., monster 6000mah battery, monster 64MP main rear camera, monster super amoled full HD+ display, and many more.. This new monster is very slim and very easy to handle and use. 4 different camera lenses helps us to captureevery type of shot as we seek in a perfect manner.Other phones Samsung don't give 6000 mah battery with the 64 MP camera and super amoled full HD display altogether at this rate.15W fast charger takes almost 1.5-2 hours to charge this big batteryvwhich lasts for almost 2 days with normal internet and other uses.So one must go for this M31 because at this price, this is the only one phone in this segment which provides customer all types of major functions at this rate.

The attached photos are taken from this phone as the font size is so small to read, Phone helped me in reading see the clarity.Now I will give 5 rating for its monster Battery of 6000mAhWhy I strictly Recommend others to go for this phone because of its lowest SAR value.Overall my rating is 5.

Even after 12 hours, i could see that the battery is at 45% or 50%.Camera is also good. Especially the front camera.In back camera, while taking a shot, it shows a point. If we adjust the direction and take it accordingly, we could get the exact shot. It is very useful for me.When comes to finger print sensor, it is very sensitive. As, it responds very quickly with a light touch.Overall, I am very much satisfied with Samsung M31

  The overall quality is super good. Face id is sometimes a little bit slow but fingerprint is super fast. Touch response is above expectations just like an iphone. Best mid budget phone in the market. The camera quality is great. Just lacks some features like  screen recording for all apps (only available for games) and edge lighting features. Battery life is good. I am a heavy user and just charges it once a day but I can play for like 4-5 hours heavy games like Call Of Duty Mobile and Pubg. I havent used camera much but the main camera is excellent. The ultra wide is not so good but it's quite usable.

The pros and cons
",4,"

  The phone is 100% value for money but it would have been far better if the Samsung had used good built quality. The finger print reader is working fine. There are so many modes in camera which I think is so cool for clicking pictures and the camera quality is much better. Well you are getting a 6000mAH battery in this one, one shouldn't be complaining about the battery life atleast. The  cons of this phone is that Samsung should have given a higher watt fast charger which is only 15 watt fast charging and the back side of the phone gets scratches all over it if you  clean the phone with a soft cotton cloth only. The backside would have been much better if they have used glass. All over the phone is best in this price range.

  The specs is incredible on paper and when I bought it and actually tested it, most of the specs hold good. The camera quality and features are very good though it may take some time to focus on the object dynamically. Normal without zoom 64MP shots are amazing and so is Macro & ultra wide. Though when zoomed the quality goes down drastically. Charging speed and battery life are decent enough and haven't seen heating issue until now. The number 6000mah maybe bloated up but the battery performance is good enough for a common user. The AMOLED display, security features and Samsung apps/shop/members are top notch! Overall, the best common use phone you can get for this price.PS: the metal back of the phone is amazing!

With fast charging 6000mah battery takes a bit time but that is reasnable. 64 MP camera is mind blowing with for different types of camera you can click different  quality images.

  Well its my first time using a Samsung android phone. To be honest I wasn't expecting that good device. I wanted a phone with good battery with a great display and m31 is a total banger om this one. The battery lasts for 2 days and the amoled screen is amazing. Apart from screen and battery this packs a great deal of utility. Samsung one ui is awesome, tbh I'm loving this. I've played cod and mcoc on this and they run quite smooth.Talking about some not so exciting feature is camera quality, on paper they look great but in original the camera is less sharp it's beautifys and soften the image. And yes it's little bit chunky in terms of weight. And yes it takes a long time to charge.Overall its a great deal.9/10 recommended.

My 1st EVER Samsung phone - Galaxy M31
",5,"

  Pros:-Long battery life with faster charging.Camera quality as per reputation that goes with Samsung Smartphones. Full screen to body ratio is the best in this league and great picture quality for media viewing.So far dropped my phone twice in one month and is working fine. Screen is water (and soap 😝) resistant so the body of the phone is pretty rough and tough. 💪🏼With a 6GB RAM and snapdragon 736 the processor is pretty good for gamers! 🎮Cons:-The only problem I personally dislike is software update demands and apps other than simple stock Android.

Great value for money

  Looked up many reviews  and purchased Samsung M31 as I was convinced that this is the phone with the most robust battery. Nothing else matters at the end of the day if you don't have  enough charge left. So this phone really fit pls the bill. The photos are crystal clear and the the 4 cameras at the back give you several options for the same.But this phone, shut off the unnecessary notifications,  put a slick black screen to help save your power.The wide Amulet display makes watching movies and ott platforms a pleasure.The sound from.the speakers are good and equally great on the headphone. Turn on the Dolby atmos if you have to giving you options for music, movies or sports. A great value for money at around 16000 rupees.

Not Happy with charging time or battery backup

  My views may change over time, but as of now not happy with battery backup or charging time.I was switching from xiaomi to Samsung as my company apps dont support xiaomi.But so far not happy with supposedly fast charging of Samsung.My MI Note 4 that is 3 years old charges faster than this brand new phone.Also my old MI Note 4 phone that is just 4000 Mah had power backup for 2 days initially when I bought it.I don't see any improvement in the new 600Mah phone with same set of apps installed. Not sure where the extra2000Mah charge is wasted

  Really good phone. Battery backup is really good, for normal use 4-5 days and for heavy use 2.5-3 days lasts. Fingerprints is really fast. Face unlocking is good also. Camera is super good. In night sky without turning on the night mode it gives really good pictures. For some reason I can't upload the night sky pictures but yes it is really good. And for video the screen is really clear and awesome. In YouTube using just 240p resolution it gives nice clean videos. And all over this is a nice good phone. I'm just loving this. Just go for this. Just worth it.

  Good value for money. Camera quality is good with live focus and changing effects of portrait mode using the different focusses available with the quad cameras. Night mode is good.Battery is good. I use hotspot from the phone for work. Even with hotspot on, charge lasted more than 6-7 hrs.Performance is fine. Gets stuck during games a bit. Battery lasts a day when used continuously. Fast charging is ok. Fingerprint sensor can be better. Overall good phone considering the features offered for the price range.

  M31 proved once again how competitive Samsung is with regards to mid range phones. It gave little space to any of its competitors to stand out.  The phone has a monster battery, a beautiful camera,  and the display is also top notch. The phone is very sturdy as well, when it comes to accidentally falling down. Also it is water proof and has endured well. Overall a very good buy. Thank you Samsung and Amazon

  Superb one from Samsung. Amazing sAMOLED screen, really fast fingerprint scanner and face unlock, 6GB ram and a fluid interface, powerful CPU, huge display, good looking and tough build quality and many more awesome qualities. What more can I want at this price. But the best thing is the monster power, 6000 mah battery runs 2 days easily. On the camera front, 64 MP Quad array and the front camera are also very good, though i personally think it could have been better. Still its one of the best in the segment. I am really happy i chose Samsung M31. Thanks a lot to Samsung and Amazon. 🙂

Best Samsung Phone Under 20K

  Fingerprint was too fast compared to other samsung devices and even some other brand devices.Battery was too huge due to which it takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes  to charge completely  but after that you can easily play for PUBG for 10 hours  so it tell how much you can get in battery backup and Camera Quality can easily be compared with latest A51. Camera has all option like slow mo super slow mo and hyperlapse.... saturation is best and you will not find any lag using the phone because it has One UI 2.0 which makes it more optimised. Blindly you can considered it for buying for normal uses.Right now it is the best phone under 18K

  Okay so I bought the phone on the day it was released. The review is based the first week usage of the phone.1. Starting big just like it's battery. The 6000 mAh battery last for a day and half on moderate to high usage of the phone.2. Camera - the quad cam setup impresses more than one can expect, specially the 64 MP mode.3. The sAMOLED screen is blessing to the eyes. Brightness is no isssue even out in the sun.4. With it's 6gb ram one can just stop worrying about the lag.5. Even though it doesn't have a glass back. It still gives a premium feel.And with the brand like Samsung it is a must go phone under 15k.

Great budget camera phone
",5,"

  It's a great mid range phone with good quality camera and battery. Camera ( both front and back ) are really good especially the macro photos really gives good picture quality.  Battery can easily last for 25-30 hours with moderate usage. Gaming was also pretty smooth..  the two 4 core processors really make the experience smooth. Had some reservation about exynos processor before buying but it seems a good one after a week of use. Transition effects are really good and always on display feature is one which i felt good as i missed that from good old. Lumia days...all in all great phone to buy

  One of the best phone from samsung. If you are looking for a low budget phone with high specifications, M31 is the right option.Finger print reader works fine and much better than my J7 prime.6000mah battery is the main advantage of this phone. Battery life is super as compared to my previous J7 prime.Camera quality is amazing during day time and its not good in the low lighting conditions.Games like PUBG,PES,etc runs smooth in this phone.In my experience Samsung's Galaxy M31 is a superb phone in this budget.(This review is written from my experience only )

  It is without doubt one of the best Samsung products I've had in a while..!! The battery life I get on this phone is incomparable. And the Quad Cam set up is also one of the best in the mid-range phones. Samsung's Amoled display is the reason because of which I purchased this phone over its competitors. Truly there isn't a better phone you can get at this price point..!!

  Ultimate mobile with good design  and excellent  features and excellent  battery backup and the main thing is that super amoled display that's far better than redmi note 9 pro and I have mi a2 but that doesn'thave amoled display but finger sensor and software is awesome  but in this m31 sometimes finger print sensor is not working and back cover is plastic that's why sweat comes fastly.

Samsung Galaxy M31
",5,"

  The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged.

  I have been using it for a week and the phone works aweasome.Handy to use and gives a premium look as well, yes it is a mega monster, battery truely lasts long and the display which samsung provides is uncomparable. Quad cameras are working at its level best, night mode, live focus, HDR, Time lapse are the features which helps to wrap up moments and this phone delivers it very gently.I never expected that I would get a phone with these huge numbers of features and the benifits, at this price range. You can enhance your way to utilise your phone with best multimedia experience.

The best budget phone I ever had
",5,"

  This is the best ever smartphone that you'll get within Rs 15000. I've bought the 128GB variant with 6gigs of ram. The camera quality is very good especially the macro. But it does pixalate the picture in wide angle. The screen resolution and color depth is pretty much vivid. And the battery, this phone can run a whole day with your location turned on and full brightness and you can even play pubg still you'll left with some juice at the end of the day. On standby mode it goes upto 3 days. Overall within 15k this is a pretty amazing phone

  This may be little costlier as compared to its Chinese competitors but its pretty good so far after using for close to a month now. Camera quality is decent,especially outdoors.. screen sensitivity is excellent, finger sensor works well though the slot is  little small to accommodate the finger:)  After full charge, if you use it heavily playing video and other app, it drops to less than 20% by second day with data enabled through out.Overall, feel happy owning it so far!!

Best Smartphone in India for 2020

  The Galaxy M31 turned out to be the most value-for-money budget phone from the Korean giant.Samsung has once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M31 has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest we’ve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M31 is a 64MP primary rear camera.The Galaxy M31 also comes with a number of other camera features, like AR Emoji, Super Slow-mo video recording, a regular slow motion mode, and a Super Steady mode that uses the ultra-wide cameras to record action camera-like videos with reduced shake.I love it .Thanks Samsung and Amazon

  I bought this as it was completing my smartphone specification needs.Loved camera and audio quality when I use video recording.From my point of view getting sAMOLED and 64 MP quad camera setup at this price point is a steal deal.When it comes to some more needful things, I would love it if it comes with in display fingerprint reader and charging adapter with more output for fast charging because it takes time to charge massive 6000 mAh battery which I took one or one and half day to drain after office uses and PUBG session.Talking about design it feels sleek and premium because of shiny finish.

  Many of brands having lots of model in market even Samsung has many but in this segment of price, M31 is having best features. I am very much satisfied with it's camera quality, battery backup. Best part is due to 6GB RAM and 128GB internal phone provides very much smoothness in handling and data storage.Only one problem is that I feel some heat when the phone is on charging and the same time i use any app but and in normal situation phone is fabulous. So from my side it is 5 in 4.9. Thank you Samsung for providing this kind of model in this price range with brand name of Samsung.

  Heat at the top-back of the phone sometimes, but not unbearable,  just get scared as you're gonna have to put it over the ear.Camera is good, a little smudgy on zoom, but captures good light and colors.Battery backup on medium use good, full charge gives a day and a half.Sleek in the hand.Lag in scrolling apps even with 6+128GB is noticeable.Wi-fi-Calling very helpful.Product info said it had sim card pin, but box did not.Too many system updates within first 2 days of using. Some apps crashed.So happy to have a good camera smartphone but I believe it can be better with the 15k budget.

Brilliant display quality and battery life with decent performance
",5,"

  Overall performance is good but the phone is not good for gaming.I you want the phone for gaming then definitely go for other phones having snapdragon processor as they are much better than exynos 9611 like on redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 pro.Also the phone has some network issues,the download speed of network is very poor and frustrating but can definatively go for it if you are a wifi user at home as outdoor network is fine.The display quality and battery backip is brilliantOverall,the phone is good and you should buy it depending on your usage.

  Superb mobile.. best mobile in this price range, best display, battery, camera and design, all too good.. must buy.. satisfaction guaranteedI use this mobile last 5 days I fully satisfied,  I really don't care about charging my mobile because it stands more than 2 days with high usage of internet and gaming.Only one negative I noticed is mobile is having heating issues while play game and charging but not too much,  this is so little while comparing to other mobiles like Asus zenfone.I'll give 9.9 out of 10... that missing one is for heating issues otherwise I love this mobile.Believe me Samsung never miss to impress you.Thanks friends bye....😇

  I am writing this review after using  phone for about a Month.Camera Quality is super.Display is awesome.Feature of time display on screen is fantastic.Initially phone was getting heated up while charging but after about a week it is Normal.Battery life is good but charging time is too high. Samsung must think of reducing charging time and it must be really a fast charging. Every one hour it charge about 30% only which is quite long time to wait.Must buy in the price range....

  It's a nice product samsung m31 is awesome for battery life and charger power of 15w is also ok..but a small folt is it should have a better processor as its processor 9611 is very old...if they have used a latest best chipset then the m31 is a alrounder.....

The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000
",4,"

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The phone is capable of recording 4K video. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job . Battery :- The Samsung Galaxy M31 is backed by a massive 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge.Fingerprint reder is good but it is not very good some time it take time to open .

Value for money buy!! But Samsung can do more...
",5,"

  Definitely a value for money buy!! Can't get better screen at this price point. Humungous Battery size helps in 1+ day with a single  charge.Have always preferred Samsung over other ""cost effective"" brands. Still couple os things that Samsung could have added to make it a killer proposition:1. 25W charger with fast charging. Sorry Samsung, 15W charger take >2 hrs to charge. That's not fast in these times.2. Have been a fan of Samsung Pay. If it can be introduces to M series as well, even if needs some hardware it will be a great addition.

  It has best Camera n Battery in its price range.  Both front and rear cameras are amazing. You can take the best pics in every shot. With the 6000mah mega battery you can use this phone nonstop for full day. And the 6.4inch SuperAMOLED Display gives higher contrast level to deliver a more detailed and clearer display, better color reproduction, wider viewing angles and more.

  You can just tap the finger to register your print and the phone unlocks lightning fast.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M31 on the rear packs a 64-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture; a second 8-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture; a third 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a fourth 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.4 aperture. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 32-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.0 aperture.This phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery.

  The mobile is beyond my expectation except in one thing. It has good camera quality when you take photos in good lighting. And the night mode is above the average. Sound quality, I found it to be very good in all the aspect. Display, very good quality. Battery life, it does worth very much to wait for 2.5 Hr charging time as it last for more than one and half day for the moderate users. By the way I didn't check if it really takes 2.5 Hr to charge up. I just go by the reviews which claims the same.And finally that one thing which has disappointed me is that this model don't have inbuilt music player.

  An excellent alternative to Chinese phones. There may be some lesser feature than Chinese alternatives but those are not important. Samsung is a most reputed manufacturer and we should try out their models as other than Apple almost no other non Chinese manufacturers are visible.

I charged the mobile to 100% and played punha for 2 hrs, it consumed just 18% of it and most important it doesn't get hot even the multiple apps are running at behind.In short I will call it as ""Beast"" in 15k to 20K range.

  Overall it's a great valued purchase.* The battery life stands up to 4 days on a decent use and no worries for 3 days on a standard usage.*The sensor is a bit slow as expected otherwise no issues.* Extremely happy with the camera quality. Only hitch is that when u click a photo in 64 MP cam a single photo is up to 25 mb which is more than a DSLR 😅. Hope this problem can be resolved in further updates if possible.* Music and all other features are up to the mark.Hope Samsung India responds to the issue with the camera storage.

  I must say that Samsung M31 is a very Nice Phone. Its face recognition is an added security feature in the phone. It touch sensitivity is too good and it has a very good battery life. Almost 1.5 days minimum it works with full use of talking, gaming, watching YouTube, etc. It takes around 1.5-2 hours for full charging but as it has a big battery of 6000 mAh so it will take that much time.

  Samsung is famous for screen quality & perfect one you're getting with this also having a battery of 6000mah you can continue to use whole day with a single charge and 64mp camera makes it complete package at this priceThe best thing is having a battery of 6000mah but still it's light in weightSpecially people who are looking for a Non-Chinese mobile, this is the one you can go withSo if you don't want to waste your money by buying a Chinese mobile than Samsung is the brand which  I I'll recommend.

The photo quality is awesome.Samsung Galaxy m31 price is worthy for such good specifications, most of space (128GB), camera  and Battery.Finger print & face recognition is security key to protect data.The Most security function of this device is that if you pit it idle for 4 hours then you have to type pin number to unlock.. finger print or face recognition will not work.

  Best phone in this price range see 9611 exynos processor is nearly same as 712g of Snapdragon. But the big big outlook of the device is the super amoled display and 6000 mili ampere battery. Believe me once u you samoled display you will not like LCD display the colours comes so beautiful and black is pure black also samoled screen saves battery  more. So go for it camera is also fantastic with many features like hyperlapse, macro,zoom, ultra wide,bokeh mode etc.

  The phone’s back is made of a hard-coated polycarbonate shell and good to look ,the screen is amazing ,  I got fairly decent performance with 6GB RAM and 128GB, and the battery is too good ,With normal usage, the phone lasted over 2 days and you don’t need to carry a power bank with you anymore. This is the power bank,I also liked the Live Focus mode, which lets you take portrait shots, which uses data from a depth sensor to produce the blurred-background “bokeh” effect when taking portraits. overall - 8.5/10 rating

  The mobile phone is really nice and looks beautiful. One thing I loved most is the battery backup it's really good and up to the expectation. The mobile phone serves all the required purposes and also is pocket friendly. The only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the phone gets heated up while charging, obviously cools done when unplugged but still its a bad point and sometimes worries me. It's really uncomfortable to talk over a phone call after unplugging it from the charger.

  Fingerprint sensor needs to be more robust. Battery charging time is more even though claimed to be fast charging. There are very many options as double tap sleep which is not available here, whereas in similar price range phones we get lot of options/features. One important thing is the charger cable length is too short, not up to the standards of Samsung. Samsung - if you are unable to provide decent features/options in this price range, please don't roll out mobiles here and downgrade your standard.

Best in all class..

  Samsung has tried to incorporate all the modern features of the segment in the Galaxy M31. It has gracefully managed to offer a slight spec bump to keep up with the latest trends. The company has proved the fact that minor updates can make a phone slightly better!The M31 brings Android 10 out-of-the-box, a 64-megapixel rear camera, a massive 6000mAh battery capacity and an impressive 6.4-inch AMOLED display. There's an adequate amount of 6GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage options too.In a nutshell, you can go for Galaxy M31 if you want a reliable battery, an immersive display and camera-centric features packed in a handset.

  I've been using samsung galaxy m31 (6GB 64GB variant) for a few days and I can surely tell you that overall it's the best budget smartphone out there in this price range.The screen is superb and I'm in love with Samsung One UI 2.0 (useful features, no clutter).Now I don't have to worry about my battery percentage or carrying a power bank.I'm not much of a gamer but I do play COD mobile and PUBG mobile and from what I've experienced both of them runs smoothly.Overall this Samsung m31 is more than enough for my usage .

Best phone .  Must buy

  The phone is really amazing. This is my second Samsung phone and I really enjoyed the features of the Camera. Pictures are stunning and beautiful. We can add many options while taking picture itself. The speed and battery life is so good.

After 60 days!!!
",1,"

  After 60 days:Great deal in this price range, especially for those who love watching videos and who enjoy music a lot and also who travel a lot.Camera is good.Battery: Without a shadow of a doubt, it's a monster. I was concerned about its charging speed; but after using this almost for a week, it doesn't bother me. It takes around 2hr30min.I'm not a big fan of games. I've been playing ""hill climb racing 2"" which shows stutter problem almost each time. Not happy about that :(Needs better optimization.

Dealbreaker phone within this budget, blindly go for it.
",5,"

  Battery life is amazing, probably the best within the category. You just charge once and forget, this is really good!!I am not a pro in taking pics but this does the job just fine in the day light and lowlight both.Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't recognize with the case. Probably due to the position within the case. However without the vase it works like a charm. I have tried many phones earlier within the same budget and have always found Samsung brand to be reliable and long lasting. Good job Samsung on this phone.

  It's been a month since I am using this mobile. I bought 8 gb version. Here are my feedback:At first it taking alot of time to charging and battery was draining very fast. But as time goes this problem is almost solved.Camera is not so good in the low light but it works well in a good light condition.Processor is good. I play PUBG on this mobile in HD setting with real graphics and it runs very smooth. No lag no heating. Loved itOver all mobile is cool and I loved. In non Chinese brands this mobile is perfect in this budget.

Really Monster
",4,"

  I am really satisfied with this phone, excellent battery backup. Now I don't need to carry charger. Awesome camera on this price. Video quality is amazing.Overall, one of the best phone I have.One problem I found is the back panel it is of plastic and you need to take extra care of it... I was waiting for best back cover but till then I have my phone got multiple rashes on back panel.And one thing is that, phone is getting on hold mode during the call. This is because, option button is getting eneble on right up side during call and accidentally it's getting touch.But Still I am happy what I got.

Finger Print Reader and Camera are best
",5,"

  I bought this Samsung M31 Ocean Blue  6GB RAM, 64GB Storage last week.I don't see any issue with the product.I am very much satisfied with the Finger Print reader and the camera quality.I would have gone for a 128GB Storage Model but unfortunately it was unavailable during the I ordered..After using multiple models of mobiles from Samsung and other manufactures, I am really happy with this model.

Best 6000 mah battery upto its name. I am loving it. My friends are also planning to buy
",5,"

  Frankly, I like its battery, RAM, and the color variant. I am a big fan of samsung mobiles. What I dislike is personal. I am bored of using same buttons in settings. Else no major flaw. I searched 6000 MAH battery but only samsung gave me the choice. Only for a change one can replace samsung otherwise it is the best. Good feature is cartoon characters replaces your face in AR emoji I enjoyed it. Palm selfie feature us awesome as usual. I am not camera frenzy although when we took pics others were envious because all others cameras were at flaw and samsung M31 is winner. They my friends deleted my pics in jealousy :-) I am loving it more day in day out

Samsung M31, a wow phone with excellent features.
",4,"

  This is really an awesome phone with all required features having best quality, be it battery life, fingerprint reader, camera or app speed with zero lag. If you don't want to go with chinese brand in mid range phones this model is definitely for you. It actually gives though competition to one plus nord, oppo reno in every segment. I am using it for more than a month and I can say it is a pure excellence. One more thing which I actually like is that this model also comes with 8gb ram.

Galaxy m31 is really a mega monster.  It's amazing
",5,"

  Samsung Galaxy m31 is totally as per my expectation. Touch is functioning acuratly. Camera quality is also very good. Battery is the most amazing thing in the phone. I charge my phone only once in a day that to not 100% but I easily get through all my day and half the next day.But slow motion video quality in not good I must say that.And yes amazon  EMI option has helped a lot to purchase this phone in budget as I have not found any EMI option offline on the stores.That's it. Overall the phone is amazing according to the price.Thank you

Best phone at this price
",1,"

  I preferred to buy Samsung to avoid buying Chinese mobiles and this is the best android mobile at this price.Better display quality compared to Xiomi models.Camara is good, capturing good images even in low light. Macro shots, slow motion videos are also good.Compared to prvious models of Samsung, sound quality is very good.Battery life is good. You can use more than a day with excess usage.One drawback for this phone is, sometimes it is getting heat on excess usage.

Got a faulty piece
",5,"

  The camera quality which i found in this piece is not good, seems like a faulty piece as when compared to the same other device it shows difference. The battery draining is also quick morr than expected in a 6k mAh battery, because of which i have placed a exchange for the same mobile. Waiting for the new one and hoping that its battery and camera quality is good as expected.

  IT'S A PHONE FOR A GUY WHO LIKE WATCHING MOVIES AND CONTENTS ONLINE.LET ME START WITH PROs -Amazing sAMOLED display,Best camera for outdoor use,Best battery 6000mAH,Light weight even with such a beast of a battery,Cons  cum word of caution -Just be little careful while handling.

  I am reviewing about this phone after 3 months of heavy usage.I am finding this phone a perfect piece in all manner.the most advantageous is its battery backup, SAMOLED display and DOLBY.I am not fully satisfied with the 15w charger provided and Camera quality.We can get 20 or 30W charger in similar range products.But the camera quality is OK if we compare to similar range phones.

  I am very much delighted after observing its battery life.i use to get 35-40hrs.Still its showing 35%.generally I'll used for calls(3-4hrs),WhatsApp,browsing & official mail work. No gaming.Quality & clarity of photos were simply awesome in a single word.It's very handy. I thought it may be difficult to handle b'coz of size. As previously I was using J7 2016.Coming to display- No wards to say . Simply brilliant.

  Buying Samsung galaxy M31 in lockdown seemed easy with Amazon. The delivery was on time and no issue came with the product.After using it for 2 months now. I can review it honestly.It's appearance is not that classic but it still looks elegant.Battery life is awesome. It charges fastly. I use it a lot to study and it can work on high power using apps upto min 6 hours continuously.Camera is very good. Minute details can be seen clearly.There are various good features in Samsung that makes it an awesome buy as always.

Best phone for normal users with big battery life
",5,"

  I chose this phone mainly because of its extended battery life, as I am a normal phone user it's a great advantage for me. I have been using this phone for the last few months and it's working well and the battery lasts for 2 days in a single charge. Camera quality is good from my perspective.The charging speed is a bit low as it takes almost 3 to 3.15 hours to fully charge the phone, don't worry I have a trick for that put the phone in maximum power saving mode and then charge the phone, it reduces around 20-30 min in your charging time ( I haven't timed it, its just approximate time). Overall it's a good phone worth buying it.

  Pros:1. 6000 mah battery is good.2. Camera is awesome, mainly wide angle shots are superb3. Previously I didn't use Samsung, I don't know about its display. But now I'm using it and sAMOLED display is awesome.4. Dolby audio is available for earphones.5. Android 10 is available.6. Heat dissipation is less.7. I bought 128GB version, and in that 116GB is available for me.8. For full charge it is taking 2 - 2 and half hours.Cons:1. As the phone is having single speaker, so Dolby audio not available without earphones.As I don't play games, so I don't think processor bothers me much.

Amazingly superb but with some minor flaws !
",5,"

  The Camera Quality is really good but I hope there could have been more options in the camera settings and the fingerprint reader is quite quick and efficient and the full HD full screen display is too good for viewing videos , shows, films etc . What is Dislike is the battery which could have been better. The battery power is said to be 6000 mah but it isn't lasting for a day sometimes . The Battery is draining a bit fast while using mobile data or Wifi ! Overall I would rate this phone 4 out of 5 stars ! Thank you for this amazing product ! The Operating system is quite good but almost similar to the previous samsung smartphones.

  Samsung galaxy m31 is a great package for the people who are on there mobile phone all day . There are many things that I like one is the super amoled display the battery and pubg for 6h a day it supports the highest graphics setting in pubg and smooth experience in day to day use . I think its the best phone in this budget segment. Not only this how can I forget the camera which is fantastic the wide angle shots and the 64 mp main shooter it amazing the picture didn't need and editing.  I am using this device since it was launched and now it is 2 weeks no issue at all . I hope you will like my review and suggest this  phone to you

Very delicate glass on the screen
",5,"

  Very good phone. But the screen glass is very delicate. I was placing the mobile in my shelf and the screen glass broke due to the slight touch of the screen to the shelf wall. Would like to repeat it was slight touch and the glass broke. There are 2 huge cracks on the screen, crossing each other at the mid spot of the screen, probably a very delicate spot of the screen. This is definitely not expected out of a mobile which has gorilla glass. Not acceptable and not satisfied with the quality of the screen glass.

  Such a awesome phone at a good price. The battery is big beast and even camera can be seen like fabulous, images are such a beast one's and night shot is lit.

Big storage 4. Super amoled display is lit. 5. For gaming its beastPUBG works like cool on this one ,even on hdr ultra settings i got no frames drop. 6. One UI 2.0 is best UI in this category. Cons: 1. Slightly heats up while charging. I'll declare that this phone is the best phone at this range.

  Really content with this purchase.The battery life is unprecedented. While I am not a heavy gamer, I either have Spotify, Instagram or WhatsApp operational at all times. And I have gone without charging the phone for 2 full days. The camera is good in the right hands as it has a few modes to choose from.Switching apps is quick. Dark mode is dark, not grey which is really good. And the OS works beautifully.I can't think of any cons other than the fact that the back cover gets scratches easily.

  Great phone at this price point. We can't expect more from a brand like Samsung at this price point. Battery life, finger print scanner are great. Both front and rear cameras are good but night mode is not up to the mark but I personally don't use night mode. Only negative thing about the device is charger it takes time to charge completely and cable is to short. In audio you can say 50-50 speaker quality above average but in earphone it has a great output because of Dolby Atmos

  I have been using the m31 for like 5 months and it's great for daily use like browsing web using social media apps and light gamming the device feels smooth to run and lags only while playing processor demanding games like pubg mobile. On low graphic settings you can play for like 20-30 min max and then it  will start lagging for the price of 15k I found it great for daily use the camera decent too the only negative thing is charging speed yeah I know it has a massive 6000mah battery but it could be better

  The best smart phone I ever bought.  Camera quality is fine. Battery life is tremendous, which runs almost for 48 hours. Speaker Volume is also adequate. The display is excellent.  Worth having it.  No issues at all.

  I post This Review after Using 3weeks. This is the Best Mobile in this Budget.# Battery is Good. NO Heating Issue. Charging  Fastely# camera Quality Is Awesome# Storage: I'm Using 128 GB.  Buying 128 GB is Better than 64, Because Of it's high Camera Quality  The Pictures are so clear with Large size. So Definitely 128Gb is Best For Photo  lovers.# One Of The LATEST Android OS Version# Color : I'm Using Ocean Blue. Its Looks So Royal.... It's so Stylish Than I expected.I'm so Satisfied with This Color Too. # Display : So GoodOver All This Is The Best Mobile In This Price

Value for Money and the Samsung Brand.

  Been using this phone for a week now, definitely a value for money. The camera is REALLY good and what makes this model stand apart is the BIG BATTERY. I've been using my phone continuously for 2 days now and I still have around 20% charge left.Not an avid gamer, but it does a good job there as well.The only drawback I felt was, no earphones/back cover provided in the box.Overall, definitely a value for money phone with the latest Android version.

Value for money
",5,"

  It's been a week since I brought this phone for studying. The battery life is not as much as expected. It's good but not upto the mark. The screen is beautiful. It's a feast for people who love watching movies on phone. The sound quality is enriching. Its gives complete performance when we use original Samsung earbuds. At this cost the camera is undoubtedly the best any phone can have. At last I would say that Samsung is a phone company that has been giving good phones and this is another monster in between those beasts...💯👍🏻👍🏻.

Awesome experience of my second phone purchase
",5,"

  A massive battery was what I looked for because I was tired of charging my phone for long hours. M 31's 6000 mah battery is huge. With one time charge, I can spend the whole day. With this comes a 128gb storage with a slot for expandable memory. And boy expand I did. Now I have a storage facility of 256 gb in total;another massive experience. Camera is one of the best in the segment. And RAM is pretty decent. Have an awesome experience with the purchase.

  General review - If you are looking for mobile which would long last without further then your search ends here . Because it's battery life is better than anyone in market.Battery life - best in marketSound - not laudable but good quality soundScreen - awesome full screen displayFingerprint reader  - would have been great if it had screen inline touch otherwise back screen touch is also fast.Camera quality - good camera quality but best thing is its wide angel view.I was iPhone user but after looking at its feature I want to say big thanks to Samsung.

  This one is greatly packed with all the required functions. The camera quality is good and the size is too. So far it is working fast with minimum lag time. The processor is fast.The finishing somehow is degraded when you compare to the flagship Samsung phones but price justifies that.

Perfect phone for budget buyers

  Before buying the phone, I was a little skeptical about its mentioned features and quality but after getting it in hand, i find everything, including camera quality, battery life and fingerprint sensor response above expectation. The only drawback is its weight but considering the 6000 mAH power it is acceptable.Making the phone water resistant would have added more strength to it.

  Really a good phone compared with the other`s Brands available in the same price range and Specs. Display, camera, Finger print scanner, fast charging some of the built in features are really good. Over all good.Doesn't comes with Head phones or any other  accessories. On Samsung site its available for less(Don`t know how their delivery service will be).Battery last`s for almost 30 hrs, on normal usage, i was in the assumption that 6000mah may last for at-least 40+hrs

  It hangs during link opening. Very good mobile but still need improvement to catch network.It is not as good as my other brand mobile to catch network of same company and at same place. Camera is very good, battery life is also good.Several inbuilt app are given which are unwanted, this is certainly not acceptable and see it's my mobile, I will decide which app will there in my mobile. Who are you to decide?As Indians started Samsung and boycotted Chinese ,you have raised price,this is not fair.

  Samsung m31 is an full combo smart phone . I'm using this phone last 15days. And i really satisfied from this phone. Man highlight of samsung m31 is 6000mah battery.

  * GUI is not so good, like other phones have.* As per specification camera is quad set up and 64 MP but that is just making it high configured, after clicking from this, photos don't look like as it says.* Processor could be better. Exynos is bit slower than Snapdragon.

This phone is good for casual gaming.Though it has an exynos processor and people prefer for snapdragon...its still works good with it.it uses the samsung one ui2 and works with the latest android 10...all good..This is the best phone for a heavy user who also insists on camera quality.

  I bought SAMSUNG GALAXY M31  SPACE BLACK  6/64 about a week ago. It was good and performance also good but the fingerprint sensor not reading properly. I am getting little trouble with it. Have to clean properly every time. And the camera at this price is too high. Mostly battery life, Mega Monster for a reason. You can't get a mobile with this features at this price. And I love the design of it, light weight cool looks don't even need a back cover the glass was soo hard and smooth. Quality of the sound is good when playing music. The DOLBY ATMOS working perfectly when you use earphones. Totally satisfied with this.

  Everything about this launch of Samsung is extraordinary. As a loyal Amazon customer for more than 5 years, I recommend this to everyone be it official uses, or gaming usage, or normal usage. This particular model can suit any purpose. No matter how much we use, the battery doesn't end just like that.Regarding performance, its Samsung AI is one of a kind and integrated with the Exynos 9611 processor, it gives a hug boost to the performance.Please go ahead and buy this. I am reviewing this after two months non stop usage!

  Love the battery life. That was my priority and I glad to say in terms of battery the product won my heart. When it comes to camera I am very disappointed as the camera performance is mediocre. The phone does not allow you to save raw files. I never faced overheating issues. Am using this for more than two month. It's a good buy for anyone who wish to gift it to their parents. The screen is equally good. Bought it at 15999/-(128gb)

  Camera works good while taking pic during sunlight but during night the picture quality is not so good. Also, picture quality not matches with the quality of the same range oppo phones. Fingerprints reader works really well.One thing which I have noticed is sometimes internet stops working in the phone all of a sudden although the newtork is full and comes back after few minutes. Don't know why this happening.  If samsung solves this problem then overall the phone is good.

  The battery life of the phone is just awesome. Last almost 2 days even aftr continuous use. The camera quality is also very satisfying and good. But it lack some useful features as inbuilt phone applock to lock apps as well as app preview from the recent screen of the phone. The security feature could have been much better if there would have been some inbuilt app or feature to help users hide photos videos and other files as it ia provided by samsumg in the galaxy A series. Overall the phone is really good and I am enjoying it.

  Thank you Samsung for coming with this good product, and coming to the review part the major reason I needed to shift to a new phone was the battery, and while travelling this was my greatest hurdle to ensure the battery doesn’t drain out till I reach Home. Hopefully the monster 6000 Mah battery saves my day. The power packed quad camera also gives an edge over me while clicking pictures at various light condition. The biometrics is functioning smoothly and backed by a good User interface. The system is powerful and smooth and yes I loved it.

  The mobile by itself is a master piece of technology and the highlights are the camera's and battery.  Value for money and promise kept well by Samsung.  This is our 4th Samsung mobile we've bought through Amazon and all are working hassle free. This master piece outwits redmi or Huawei by miles in performance and battery life. The draw back is that its has a heavy built and weighs a bit. But Indian people like the reliability than looks. To sum up,  this is a monster of a deal.

  The M31 is the best smartphone in the range. The camera quality is pretty good, capable of taking clear photos in dark conditions too. Moreover no compulsion to use a watermark at the corner of every click. Also the system UI is ptetty user friendly, with lot of pre installed apps modifiable  and unistallable.The battery quality is mammoth and it will easily  be good for 1.5 days of average phone usage.I am not much of a gamer, so not much about the processor. But photo editing software and etc works pretty smooth.

  The phone is excellent to use for entertainment and media consumption. The cameras are good, especially the front for video calls. The software experience is smooth and without lag.

Since having mali GPU, the gaming performance is average.The display is also very good. The only thing which disappointed me is sound.

  Overall, good phone in its price bracket. Stand out features would be Super Amoled screen and massive battery which lasts day and a half with more than normal use. Samsung brand backing is an added advantage. Camera performance is very good in proper lighting conditions. No lag noticed even after loading bunch of apps. It would be interesting to see if it can give same performance after 6 months of usage.Final verdict: Go for it if you are not an heavy gamer and high quality basic requirements (screen, camera, battery) in limited budget are your priority. You will not regret your decision.

  Reviewing this phone after 20 days of heavy use.The looks,display, camera, battery life of this phone is really good.I am not a heavy gamer but the limited no. Of games of Pubg etc.I played in these 20 days, the performance seemed to be alright.The phone audio is loud and proper but it could have been louder, the voice output in earphones very loud though.It is a really good purchase in 16k. Value for money.

Samsung M31 : A thing of beauty is a joy forever!

  Samsung M31 has been a sort of wonder ever since I possessed this gem of a smartphone. It's superfast fingerprint reader, long lasting battery life, resplendent amoled screen and an excellent camera which produces amazing,real, life like images can easily put other smartphones into limbo. It's a blind buy for anybody who will undoubtedly fall in love with its 'friendly' features.  Now don't wait for it, just run and grab from a neighborhood store or just 'Amazon' it.

Honest review

  Samsung m31 is a mega monster to me because 6000 mah battery is the one of most  important factor with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, 64mp back cam and 32mp front cam.Perfect phone at this range of amount. The box has a charger,  sim slot pin and a guideline for the  users. Processor  is also fine for user if they play PUBG game or like other games.Battery charging is my unlike factor because its take more time.My Request  to  the Samsung,  must provide a back cover  and a screen guard to the phones.

  Using it from past three days, Processor is very fast and both back and front camera's are good. Very smooth display. Overall I can say, Buying this phone for an moderate user like me will be a good decision.I had a little tension before about how the phone will be.  Because by reading of mixed reviews and also I had some doubt about getting great specifications for this price range. After getting the phone into my hand and using it I feel everything is wonderful in this phone.

  Nice phone. I will give extra weightage to this device since it is not China made. Now, coming to the functionality,  it gives me all facilities to work from home.

Lastly, camera quality - it has hell lots of functionalities that I'm yet to explore. Overall, happy experience.

Review after using it for a week

  Camera is really good. Both the front and rear camera.Display is absolutely stunning. SAMOLED display.Battery life is incredible and battery saving option works totally great. Used it for a full day and battery was still at 60% with saver on.Phone audio is crisp and nice. Performance of the phone is also very good I frequently use a bunch of apps together and play games too, it does not lag. The best thing about M31 is it's User Interface. It's clean and simple unlike other UIs like MiUi which is totally trash. There aren't any bloatwares in the phone.Overall a perfect phone 10/10.

Charger pin length little more
",1,"

  1. The mobile is very good and user friendly. The quality of photos are exorbitant. The battery is also very good. If I use the internet for about 10 hours a day the battery stays for 2 days.2.Though fast charging is provided,  to get full charge it takes about three hours. The pin provided for the charger is little small in length compared to other c type chargers.  Sometimes if I do not press the pin phone is not charging.  So I have to press the charger once again.

  Have been using M31 for a week now.It is everything you need from a ₹15000 phone.-An amoled display showing accurate colors.-Exceptionally large battery, can easily go through a day even with wifi on.- It has a good solid built quality .- Best thing about this phone is its camera. Which produces accurate colors and take amazing pictures.Will recommend this to anyone who wishes to spend this much on a mid range phone.In comparison to other brands I chose samsung beacuse of Samsung's deliverance of a quality product and good chain of serivce centres across my state.

  An awesome phone for the price paid. Got it delivered within one day of placing the order. The M31 has a pretty interesting four camera set up on the back and the selfie shooter too is decent but the main focus has always been on the 6000 mAh battery which hopefully will last 2 days. This is the main advantageI am very much impressed with Samsung M31 by its look and design.By the way, the Super AMOLED screen is GORGEOUS. The battery life is really amazing on this phone. Even after playing heavy games for long and watching videos with heavy usage, the battery lasts 2 days.

Really Mega Monster 👌

  Samsung M31 is a value for money phone, I have 6/128 varient, performance is great no hangging issues. I play lot of games, watch youtube. I have been using this device for last 2.5 months, I am totally satisfied, Superb screen, suberb battery life. It is slightly heavy but for 6000mah battery its just fine. Camera is decent. This is best phone at this price point. Only one drawback that I felt Samsung should've provided a 22-25 watt fast charger instead of 15 watt as it takes around 2 hours 20 mins to get fully charged.

Best phone in just Rs. 15000
",4,"

  It is a best phone in the range of 15000. Fingerprint reader of m31 is great it just takes a moment after touching your finger to the sensor. Its battery is awesome, I can't believe that it has 6000 mAH battery. Camera is mind blowing, 64 MP camera in such a low price. What more I say about m31.... Thank you Samsung for manufacturing this device in such low price.

  Initially I was about skeptical on buying a sub 20k phone. . But from the time I started to read about the model and specifications , something was pulling me towards this phone and when I received my order . I knew that it was my best decision that day. . The vibrant screen to the diverse camera options to the best battery life on any smartphone made this piece an awesome choice. Altogether getting it from a brand like Samsung was the best of all. . Enjoying the phone day to day . . . Quiet a Monster M31 is !!!!

  O have purchased Samsung galaxy M31 smartphone. Its worth to see and use. Good quality phone with friendly features and better ergonomics. Due to best ergonomic quality I feel proud to use the mobile GalaxyM31. Price is also better. Earlier I had used Chinese MI phone but comparing both performance I feel that Even galaxy M31 being little more price than MI phones, is better option. Thanks Samsung galaxy.

  This is the best phone in this price range. Most of the features in the phone are very good and easy to use. One of the best feature is its camera. Its cameras and their picture quality is best. Its battery life is quite good. One charged, it last more than 24 hours. Many apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime come already installed with new phone which comes handy. Moreover many apps of Samsung are quite good feature of the phone. Overall this is one of the best phones in the market.

  Before starting I tell you I'm not a big fan of Samsung's smartphones. But this phone is a gamechanger on itself. Screen, camera, processor, built brilliant, and ohoohooooo battery life is beyond expectation. Though the design isn't that modern but if you add up a trendy cover you won't feel sorry for that. MOST IMPORTANT IT IS A NON CHINESE COMPANY AND MADE IN INDIA SMARTPHONE.

A great phone from a democratic Country. Ditch China

  Got it for 17,499A ""made in India"" product from the south korean giant. One fusion plus of Motorola comes with made in india tag too but I like south korea's policies and I don't like China's so in the end no money to China that is satisfactory for me.  I like features of one fusion plus too particulary its stock android feature and i think samsung should also launch a few phones with this feature at affordable price. Other than that top class, all features great. Thumbs up to Samsung and South Korea.

  Overall M31 6GB/128GB is a complete package worth for Rs.15999. It has best Camera & battery in this amount.But processor Samsung M31 has exynos 9611, should have snapdragon 7932. It is compatible but not that much fast as snapD...I order for Ocean Blue.. Amazon sent me Black coloured... that is really bad on Amazon part.. I still kept this piece as I was OK with the colour.Sound quality is good. With headphones the feature of DolbyAtoms is awesome..It is a better mobile to use, in this amount..

  The phone is amazing, Amazon delivered it 4 days before the day of delivery. As for phone itself.. It works great! 6000 mag battery gives me about 11-12 hours of screen on time, the display is amazing. General task are done very smoothly, though this is not a gaming phone. I reckon this is the Best Non chinese phone you can get. Cause the hardware of camera and battery excede the last year samsung A50 which is about same price... if in the market of samsung, this is the best

  I have always loved the Samsung UI because of its clean interface and next to no trash. As a person with a minimalistic approach towards products, the all black phone suits my purpose. As far as the review of the phone goes, most tech review videos  dont do justice to the phone.

  The BESTTTTTTT mid range phone in the market!The battery lasts forever and needs only one charge to last 2 days. The camera is not the best but works as good as a 50k phone camera under favourable light conditions. The build is very sturdy and the phone is not very light or heavy which gives it a nice feel on the palm. For gamers, dont you worry, PUBG works at extreme frame rate with HD graphics. Totally worth the money!

  Samsung outdid themself, I have to say it's one of the best value smartphone ever from samsung. The 6000 mah battery makes the battery life last for 2 days before charging and having a dedicated fingerprint reader is faster and better than the on screen one in this price range, and the quad camera setup with 64 mp main sensor gives u the best camera quality in a smartphone of its price range along with samsung super amoled display the best in class display. All in all the best value for money smartphone from samsung.

  After using this phone over 3months you can totally relly on it's battery back up. Rear camera is best at this price segment but front camera didn't deserve much appreciation. Samsung has to work on it's software functions to improve the speed and multi tasking accessibility which 6GB RAM can handle easily. Heating issues can be faced in daily routine but one of the greatest thing is phone didn't feel much heavy and it's weight balance is awesome.Overall you can't deny to buy this one at this price point.

  Fingerprint reader is really good but you must have really clean finger or else it won't work .like if you are eating or wet you hand it will not work . I have added both hands  for smooth function.6000 mAh Battery ...  is wonderful . I can watch videos without worrying about charging.64 MP Quad Camera...capturing video  and pictures is impressive.  I am still exploring various modes but so far it is outstanding.It's an awesome mobile in this range...

An awesome phone
",4,"

  Excellent mobile. No words. Fingerprint reader is so quick especially when you are using biometrics for banking and other apps. Battery is really a monster. I am charging it once in two days only inspite of prolonged use of Netflix, Prime and Youtube. Camera is also good and helps in taking better pictures than other mobiles in this price range. Samsung just cracked the Chinese!!!!

Nice phone but processor could have been better
",5,"

  The processor is slow. Even with 6 gigs of ram u would have trouble sometimes. It seems apps are not optimised for the screen. Daylight pics are amazing but night shots are dull.battery is good about 9-10 hrs of on screen time...display is crisp and amazing. User interface is good. After about 2.5 months of use I have seen a decline in battery performance by around 40 percent. Guys take care while buying it only for battery. I saw the decline once I charged it for 100% and after that i had seen a 40% decline in battery performance even with lowest brightness .

Good phone to buy

  Camera quality is good but autofocus takes time, macro mode (taking photo very close to object) is very good. Face ditection is not very good.Touch and finger print reader works fine.Battery life is really good. I face some random issues like some time camera functions are disabled. Then they become ok. Some times mobile switches off while using. Otherwise it is good phone. Can buy at this price.

Best budget phone
",1,"

  I've been using Samsung since a long time my 1st phone was Samsung Galaxy J2 then Galaxy J7 Prime, then Galaxy J7 Max and now this Galaxy M31 so my review is, this is the best Samsung I've ever used in my life in fact it is the best budget phone believe me, Camera is outstanding and can even compete with some flagships finger print reader is fast and Battery is superb if you use it from 100% it'll last whole day if you only surf internet gaming performance is great too. I love this phone ❤.

  So far so good , all results are upto the expectation.Very minor suggetions, can improve on muti window handling whe  we get the call while accessing  any other app, diring the call or after call that app window should  come with last seen screen in that respective  app, contact search can be more faster

Reliable companion
",5,"

  I have been using galaxy m31 for the past 5 months and I'm pretty satisfied with the product. It's highly reliable with excellent battery backup that lasts upto 2 days. The camera quality is above average especially at day light. The slow motion video recorder works really nice. The software is easy to understand and can handle everything without much hazzle. One area that needs improvement is the plastic back case. It really spoils the aesthetic appeal of the device.

"
Amazon Customer,"
Don't fall for the 64MP camera
",5,"

  Please don't fall for the 64MP camera. There is only an option to choose 64MP picture. But when you choose that option, there are too many limitations. You cannot use flash, cannot take picture in low light, cannot zoom etc. These limitations are never told anywhere. Otherwise the camera is a normal 16MP camera which is not that great when compared to other similar phones.Otherwise the phone is good with good response with its 6gb ram.

"
MANU Shaji,"
Not very satisfied, but kaam chalao kinda phone
",5,"

  1) Touch Screen and finger print sensor are just too sensitive, do not understand the difference between intentional and unintentional touches, which creates a lot of frustration.2) The phone does have a tendency to slow down too early in its lifespan, it's an issue which must be addressed. We need to constantly clear out the clutter, even though it has a 6 GB RAM

  I have been using this phone now for two weeks. Iam delighted to acknowledge that for what amount I spent I bought a pretty nice phone. Battery life is great, finger print scanner works  fast, touchscreen is also very smooth.I can click colorful photos with a wide angle feature also.One thing I would suggest is if the company could out an option for the customer that if want the protection cover also for the phone otherwise customer has to find it separately.

  I have been using m31 since more than 2 months and I'm amazed by the features and promising specification samsung has provided as this is my first phone of samsung. Though I was doubtful to buying this but glad I have chosen m31. The front and rear camera quality is truely awesome. There is no battery issue i just charge my phone once in a day and next day morning it show me still 17 percent battery remaining 😊 so ya battery life is so too good of this phone. Fingers print reader is also good.

Fun phone with barely any rivals for that display.

  Amazing phone with a stellar display, while performance isn't towards the higher side, the phone makes up for it in its beautiful display and huge battery, the best part about the phone is that it doesn't even feel heavy. The camera is okayish, focusing is a tiny bit slow because of that huge 64mp sensor, it's great for the price and can sometimes produce better photos than my mom's S10 plus, because of the higher resolution.Comment down below for any queries.

However ,this mobile  is MEGA MONSTER.
",4,"

  Design is very good. Battery life outstanding. Camera is very good in day light but blurness in low lighting conditions . Display is excellent. This mobile is not meant only for gaming. If you think that this mobile is only for gaming then heating issues will arise . So this mobile is not suitable for gaming for long hours. But you can play well in this mobile. If you want to buy this m31 I recommend you to buy 8 gb ram and 128 gb rom variant.

Review of Samsung M31
",5,"

  Battery is big and has a lengthy life in one charge. But  it took 4.30 hours to get full charge.  15 volt charger is not enough, 25 volt would be worthy. Camera is of good quality. But no option to set high resolution for still photography is available in camera setting. Video shooting can be done with high resolution . Finger print is quick responsive. Mobile looks good. It is a good mobile in this budget segment . After use of one month I am satisfied with its performance.

  Things which make this device a good pick:1)Amoled display makes the user experience really smooth.2)camera quality in outdoors is amazing.3)body design is nicely crafted,people asked me which phone is this often.4)the user interface is nicely designed so there is no confusion and mismanagement.Few cons:1)Camera can dissapoint sometimes in low light.2)battery drains faster but 6000mah manages it well.3)charging upto 70% is fast then it takes time

  The phone is really good, having best display, battery life. But the camera is not clear as it has 64mp camera. It looks like 16 Mp front facing camera as it has 32 Mp. Battery is so good that u can use the mobile whole day if ur heavy user. I recommend this mobile for it's good display and battery life. If your pubg lover with heavy user go for other phones. But I like this phone very much because it fulfills my needs. Thanku Amazon for the fast delivery.

  This is the best budget phone. It works pretty well for its price and has an amazing camera. The OLED screen is another major advantage. The battery is large but it's software is what helps the most, as in there are several power saving modes to make it last even longer. I had some issues with the display as it was not responding after merely 15 days of purchase however it was just a software issue and was resolved by updating the software at a nearby Samsung service center for free.

  The display is top notch and the best in the price segment. It's not so heavy even though it comes with 6000mAh battery. Software feels lite and not bloated unlike other brands' phones in this price segment. The quad camera and the ocean blue give a rich look to the phone. I have used the phone outdoors for more than a day with considerable charge left.  Camera is also pretty good for taking normal and wide angle shots. Low light photos are not as good as expected but decent.

  This phone is made for me. With the best quality 64mp camera, 128gb massive storage and 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor, this phone is a beast. It can run pubg in HDR with ultra fps without any problem. If u game atleast 3 hours a day, this phone can survive the whole day without charging. and due to the brand value of samsung, this phone takes over the phones of china brands like mi, oppo, vivo, and poco. If you cant go for m31s, go for this phone. you will not regret it.

  I transitioned from using an Android 7 phone to Android 10 with this phone. I bought this because of the 6000 AMH battery, and it has not disappointed me. The phone lasts me atleast 1.5 days without any issues. The system doesn't hang due to the 6 GB ram. I love the dark mode on it and some of the Samsung apps as well. The 64 megapixel camera works well and is good also for night time shooting ! I would recommend this phone, especially if you are looking to near stock android phone experience.

  Samsung is a brand I trust more then any other brands . It brings out its newest model in the best affordable range with maximum and new features .SamsungM31 is light weighted and has great battery life.

  Fingerprint reader works amazingly  smooth. Battery  life allows you to enjoy fully. Camera 64MP quite satisfactory. 6GB RAM is so fast that you can watch video, online classes without  switching off Data Saver and power On mode and saves a lot of data and battery. 128 GB ROM is tension free. Big value for money. Earlier I find Samsung mobile were very costly, this time Samsung has  intelligently  kept its price at a very competitive rate to surprise the customers with price +features.

  Galaxy M31 mobile is a miracle mobile phone for samsung for this time. Now indian market capture various china company so this is turning mobile handset for samsung. In my vision  samsung means extraordinary, stylish, and proud this hand set maintain all the things.M31 look is outstanding, monster battery 6000 mah this is best in class mobile for samsung and camera graphics is always perform by samsung.So. This is generation chenger phone for samsung in cheaper price.

  Fantastic built with an elegant design.Pros:1. Depth of the display is excellent. Very crisp.2. Long lasting battery life. It's really amazing.3. Camera clarity is good in day light.4. Android 10 UI customized by Samsung has a classy seamless flow.5. Face recognition speed is impressive.6. Smart pop up notification is useful.Cons:1. Low light camera is not up to the mark.2. Auto focus snapping is disturbing.3.On-Screen Finger print sensor would have been better than the one on back side.

M31 👍
",5,"

  I have used everything from Apple to Nokia and was very doubtful about taking Samsung though my experience with S3 had been really nice. This has been really pleasant experience. The phone is terrific except a few rare lags/hangs here and there.  My brother has an A50 and recently I gifted my mother a M31 too. To add to the list A8 plus with my dad has also been flawless.I would reccomend it for people who are looking forward to a pleasant experience with a budget phone.

It's a great phone for day to day use
",5,"

  As expected the camera and screen quality of the Samsung M31 is very nice. The 6000 mAh battery easily last 1 and a half days after a full charge. The fingerprint reader on the back is also very accurate until your is wet. The charger that comes in the box has an output of only 15w which is slow given the huge battery capacity. Also the design of the phone is ok for the price. Also no bloatware or ads on the one ui which is also great.

  I have been using Samsung smart mobiles for the last 4 years, J7Max, A50 and now M31. And will use Samsung mobiles only in the future as well as they are easy to use and very user friendly. The camera is awesome and the battery life is excellent even after using it for the whole day. Cant ask anything better at this price. All boxes ticked well.... as mentioned in the features. Go for this phone.

  Using this Beautiful phone since a couple of months. It has a satisfactory long lasting battery.I dont have much heavy use of applications. I use it for watching movies for several hours and dont find much heating of the phone. The camera quality is awesome.Per my calculations, if you have a continuous use of internet, the battery drains at an average rate of 7% per hour which is quite satisfactory.Overall I have a great experience after using this for 3 months.

  Have been using this mobile since a month.Camera, Batery, Performance is great.Had played games like COD, Asphalt 8/9, PUBG-M. PUBG-M works very well, i didn't saw any frame drop or lagg while playing in 'Smooth, Extreme' and 'Ultra,HD', these settings are usually available in flagship phones.Screen is excellent.One UI 2.0 works well.THIS MOBILE IS MANUFACTURED IN INDIA, I.E. WHOLE PRODUCTION IS DONE HERE.A bit delay in fingerprint sensor, but OK.

Phone feels like home
",5,"

  Pros : good battery life - a little lesser than what I expected of this phone but still really good.Amazing camera : very good camera. Both front and back cameras are really good.Smooth functioning: very good experience with this phone.Cons : a little heavy.Looks aren't as good as the A51 I was considering.  But it's a worthy sacrifice.Fast charging takes 3 hours. Even if you connect it to a 25w charger. It will take 2and1/2 or 3 hours to charge.

Best non-chinese phone at this price range
",4,"

  Phone is good overall for this price range and being a non-chinese phone.Fingerprint reader is slow or takes more than one attempt sometimes.Camera quality is great. AR features and 64MP shooter is wonderful! However lowlight photos is greatly pixelated and not worth try.Being a moderate user, I have to charge the phone about 90mins a day. Sometimes the battery usage for background apps is higher than usual. But it does last over 24hours with just single charge.

  Best phone at this price range ..This phone is good but how to use 8mp and 5mp camera?8mp wide angle lens just tap wide mode on the screen (the logo with 3 trees at the bottom)5mp deep sensor lens just tap a photo in live focus under more options5mp macro lens just take a macro shot 3-5cm which is also in more optionsYou can pull the live focus & macro mode to the front for easier access..Battery life good ..

  The stabilization of the camera is just awesome! Can u believe that all those pictures are taken from a fast moving car ???  Even I didn't realize how amazing it is until I took those pictures.

The display is amazing , processor may not be that great while comparing it with others at the same price point. Overall it's a good phone

Review of M31,128GB

  Crisp display, long battery life, awesome camera are amongst the pros of this product. Touchscreen works so smoothly....However, a bit faster fingerprint sensor or on screen fingerprint sensor may take this product to the next level.I don't have any lagging or hanging issues till now, works very fine with me. But incorporation of much modern processor is further appreciable.

  Using it from last 3 months, found no issue yet.Best thing is the main USB of the phone, its 64 MP quad camera, shoots amazing photos and video. Also the front camera is very good.Have smooth performance while playing games like PUBG. Also have 6000 mAh battery  so you can play games, movies etc. for a long time. So overall it's a very good phone in this price range than other brands. Also no unnecessary ads issues with other brands, have very clean and nice UI without any unnecessary preinstalled apps.

I am using this device from last one month and I found it quite good no lagging at all, fast fingerprint and face unlock. Good build quality too. They just need to give charging cable somewhat longer than current one. It's too short. SOT is also good without playing pubg you can run your device for almost 2 days. In PUBG too there is no lag that's quite cool.

  Have been using this device for the past two months. The main highlight is the battery life, it lasts more than one day even with very heavy usage. The camera is great in outdoor lighting but in indoor lighting the photos are just average. While in low light the photos are very disappointing. Finger print sensor is fast and detects most of the time. Also, the Super Amoled display is fantastic, the colours look great. For the price point, this is a great phone.

  This, product is good but the only thing is the camera quality. It can't take low light pictures and in also highlighted areas the camera can't stable it very well but in normal picture this is a beast in all of the above. Is selfie is good and take wide angle pictures very well. Battery is very good as a 6000mah. And the finger print scanner is not working so fast but not also so slow. They can give much better finger print scanner in this price range.Thank you.☺️☺️

Good phone for daily usage and pubg/cod gaming. Good battery life
",5,"

  Very good phone at the price point. Screen is wonderful as well as battery life. Camera can do better but at this point only Motor one fusion plus has better specs (leaving the likes of ad infested Xiaomi, Realme phones aside). Games like pubg and COD run quite well at high settings. Fingerprint sensor is tacky though. Often refuses to recognise the print if it's slightly grimy or wet. Overall a very good phone for daily usage.

Battery back up is very powerful
",5,"

  I have purchased this phone for battery back up requirement and camera. I am fully satisfied with my choice. The battery back up is very good. I can use my phone for about 1-2 hours only after getting it charged for 5-10 minutes if the battery is fully discharged. Most interesting thing I got to know after purchasing of this phone, the pic editing options of this phone. A normal click pic can be converted in to a professional click pic. Screen is very smooth.

Over all its a good mobile.

  Over all its a good mobile. Camera is a good one. Some time it creates best images and some time worst images. Battery backup is not more than a 4500mah phone. Charging is taking around 3 hours. Phone is bit heavier. Speaker phone volume is bit lower. I am not a gamer, so all over performance is good for me. Fingerprint sensor is fast. Like always display is the best in this price bracket.

Do buy but not from Amazon
",5,"

  It looks good, heavyweight not sleek in design. But in day light the pictures and clarity is awesome. U get good pictures in this budget range. However, this phone only comes with charger and no ear phone provided. If you really want to purchase go with this phone but do not buy from Amazon worst experience as many buyers already mentioned electronic complains does not provide warranty card and seems like it has been opened earlier. Buy from trustworthy e commerce website.

  Over all phone is osam , very rear combination of bujet and quality,  it's a protection with gorila glass 3 but as user i recommend  handle with little bit care , company doesn't  give you a replace of screen after its breaks , so donot measure it's temper of screen.

Great phone for moderate usage!
",4,"

  Pros:1. Excellent display quality.2. Decent battery life.3. User friendly UI with lag free experience.4. Phone is not too heavy considering the battery capacity.Cons:1. Photos from Selfie come out to be soft in indoor lighting condition, Even after disabling the beauty mode the camera tries to smoothen the skin tone, I hope a software update for front facing camera can fix it.2. Photos from macro camera seems average.3. Overall I would say this phone's camera needs software optimization.

Hit and not miss exactly.
",4,"

  The Galaxy M31 is well made phone with good display. I'm impressed with the performance, the software experience and especially the terrific battery life. The 64MP camera also takes good quality pictures. The impressive 64MP camera on the back is also outnumbered by its lackluster siblings, whether it's the soft and mediocre ultra-wide lens or the largely useless macro and depth cameras would. I recommend it as one of the options to consider when purchasing a phone in this price range.

  The samsung M31 has it's both pros and cons.lets talk on the pros, the battery is a monster, obviously its 6000mah you can use it all day,and the camera is also decent enough for a budget phone, I have posted the sample images of camera quality. Also the display is great.The cons come in as a minimal heat issue but bearable. And not for gaming as you notice minor lags after more than 1hr of play.Other than that it's a value for money.

  There is nothing one can dislike in this smartphone, it's more than what it is priced at.

As both the device has a monster battery , monster camera , s maloed screen working too fast processor a charger. I have both in black colour . Only lacking is the guestur cannot compare with my Moto g 4plus . Solid gestures just simply move the hand your result is ready with different applications . I need Samsung to work on it.

Try Samsung Galaxy m31. It's the good Choice.
",4,"

  6GB+128gb. It's  quiet awesome. Performance is very good. The above uploaded photos are taken in SAMSUNG Galaxy m31. In low light mode m31 is good comparing redmi note 8 pro. Battery backup is more than 24hrs including usage of Online streaming, PUBG game, calls, Facebook and whatsapp. Average battery drains per hour is 2.166% without gameplay. In this segment, this is a very good smartphone. In higher graphics of PUBG , frame is dropping off little but gameplay was very good. I don't like to be finger captured in backside because of Plastic.

  After using the phone after 2 weeks . I came to the conclusionPros- 1.Battery life is excellent.2. Camera quality is decent in this range.3. No lagging after using it for long period of time.4.Display is quite versatile.Cons-1. It's  a heavy phone since its carrying at 6000Mah battery.2.Knox security which is Samsung's  own feature should have been there in this range of phone.Overall it's  a good phone with decent battery backup.

  Though it is costlier than from Chinese companies. This is a really good phone, especially for users who want to learn photography and videography. The RAM is good. I have edited and created videos with length ranging from 4 mins to 32 mins.So before spending a bomb on cameras and video editors. Spend on this phone and use free editors like InShot.But do buy a mic since, like other phones this one too captures all the sounds in its vicinity.

  It's been 20 days using new M31. Literally this phone has a huge battery backup even having a powerful processor. And having a massive battery, phone is light to use as compare to Poco X2 and other brand's phone. The phone has 15w fast charging system which helps to charge up the phone within 2 hrs. And there are many features which makes phone best in 2020 as per my opinion. And Samsung has the largest manufacturing factory in India so it is fully made in India phone.

Great Camera quality, good battery and good fingerprint sensor
",5,"

  The screen is really smooth. Fingerprint reader is a bit too small maybe that's why it doesn't detect as fast as Xiaomi phone's fingerprint sensors. Battery is good. On a normal day with continuously using your phone, it takes 8 hours to go from 100% to 48%. If left like that, it stays at the same percentage or goes just one percentage down. Camera quality is really good. It takes great pictures even at night.  Selfies are high quality. Even the back camera is so good.

  I really loved this phone - Samsung M31. It takes videos like a professional movie camera, it gives cinematic experience. Macro of this mobile is the best i can say. Its wide angle camera shoots far better than any other mobile out there. Few things i can honestly tell are that the speakers of this mobile are not that high bit are absolutely fine, performance is incomparable

Good but not up to the mark
",1,"

  Cam performance is good, at starting there is a trouble while using camera my phone has been restarted frequently I took Samsung assistance and it's resolved. Performance is good but it's not up to the mark phone is been hanging after using for a long time need to resolve it in the next update and there is no inbuilt app security heat heating issues so be there after using for a long time. Overall the performance is good

Good product but still iPhone is best
",4,"

  This is a good product from samsung. I have been using itsince a week and it's working fine.  I was using iPhone before that and using android from iPhone was too difficult for me but this phone somehow worked on my expectation. Still I would recommend if your budget is good go for iPhone.

  Actually I'm using this phone M31 since February 2020, I have become fan of it. I'll suggest everyone of you to go for samsung M series mobile like M21,30,30s,31,31s since of its power packed embedded system. Till date I couldn't found any problem like hanging or latencies. Fingerprint sensor response is awesome is quite fast than other mobiles in this price range. Camera is awesome with special features. Really it's a Monster as name suggests.!

Very addictive
",4,"

  M31 is very much useful for those who prefer mid range segment for its amoled display, battery life , good fingerprint reader and face unlock. We get addict to this given android 10 UI.... For me it's amazing to watch movies, webseries.... Gaming performance also nice for below average gamer like me .. cameras are perfect in day light compared to night love light which is slight disappointed.. overall it's satisfied samsung branded mobile...

Good phone but picture quality is not good for a 64 MP quad camera setup
",5,"

  Overall phone is very good 👍 to use. But as Samsung mobile, it's not justified with the picture quality. Low light pictures are becoming very blurry, and in full or day light also it's not upto the mark.

A good phone for small budget.
",5,"

  Battery life is not that much good if you have low range and network distributions battery life is almost one day not more than that, camera is good wide view range is give better experience, fingerprints reader is unsatisfied is not that much quicker or sensitive or not easy to use because it's designe is so flat so take a lot of effort for it. Otherwise its look is better and back panel tuch filling is rich good for handling for one hand.

  It's been a while since I have started using this mobile. The back camera is marvelous  however front camera needs  more improvements particularly  in low light. It would have been better if flashlight  in front also would have been there.However  the battery  life is monster and is superb for gaming purpose.It's a win win situation  for anybody having this mobile.

Samsung M31 the mid range beast.
",5,"

  This phone is a beast. The things that could have been focused on are ""Fast charging charger as the 6000 mah battery took almost 3 hours to get fully charged"" & ""Back cover quality which seems to be cheap"". Except these this phone fares really well with this price tag.

  Finger print sensor is awesome, the quick way it unlock the phone is very satisfying.Camara quality is way beyond expected the color of image & contrast rate is nice. Options provided in pro mode is very nice & useful, selfi Camara also playing very nice role. It is also quick in unlocking phone by face recognition.Battery life is fo far good, I was expected battery will  comes around 2 days but getting around 1.5 can't say it is bad. Optimizing the apps may give more efficiency.

Absolutely beautiful beast
",5,"

  Three things which mattered, display, battery and interface ; all are absolutely perfectly balanced. At the price point its amazing. You can continue to use the beautiful display for long duration without the need to worry about the battery charge. The Samsung UI is as usual updated and getting better. The camera is OK; need to explore more, however initial assessment is above average but no comparisons to the likes of S8 / S9.

  It is one of the best mid range phone available in the market and don't know if you can get a better deal than this beauty, pretty sturdy looking and is perfect for daily use. The 64mp camera is a megastar and selfie cam just makes it perfect for attending class. 6000mah nattery runs a day and a half with no sacrifices to make. Just a lil bit slow charger otherwise it is absolutely amazing smartphone, great work by Samsung. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.  -Arnab Patnaik

  it is the best phone I've ever bought. It is simply elegant, be its 6000 mAh battery, infinity display, 64mp quad-camera setup, and the Samsung one UI 2.0 which makes it out of the box. Its performance is best, its battery works really long, its biometrics are best, screen quality is awesome, and the camera captures almost every detail, even in the night.Overall,  the phone is packed with so many features and it comes at such a price. The phone is indeed a #mega-monster!

  I was thinking to buy Samsung S20 Ultra. One of my friend told me about M31 launch and i checked about the features on internet. I fell in love with M31 and decided to go for it instead of S20 and i am proud to say that my decision was correct. This is a Mega monster for sure. 64 MB camera, 6 Gb RAM, 128 Gb memory and 6000 mAH battery. Everything is same as what you expect from a flagship phone. Camera is awesome, features are superb and no comparison to the battery, it lasts for 2 days for me. Thankyou Samsung for M31 launch.

  The battery life is out of this world,one feels as its battery never runs out.Amoled display stands out with the crisp images.These two features makes this phone binge watchers dream.The processor is exynos9611 which might be a minor con for hardcore gamers but it did great while I played PES. The camera is really great too,it clicked amazing pictures outside and the front camera also boasts of great quality.Overall,this is the best phone in this price range.

  I bought this phone for my mother and did quite a good testing myself. I was initially confused If I should go for those realme phones due to the specs but I am glad I went with Samsung. Majorly due to the after sales service. The phone has amazing battery life, and performs smoothly. The camera could have been better. The display is the best part of this phone ! Good contrast! Also, with the special 'U' notch this phone looks top notch!

  Pros : The product looks amazing.. camera is awesome.. sound is good.. product comes with gorila glass and its little bit weight which is an advantage for me.. no heating problem so far.. on the whole I just love it.

While ejecting SIM slot should be very carefull since it's very thin which may break if we push harder.

  Best phone in this price level.  Overall performances are very good except camera.  Camera is far better than M30&M30S but could be a little more better.  You can't use flash in 65MP and UHD resolution doesn't support video features. Apart from these..camera is fine.  Nice shots can be made easily with this one. Battery is the best part of the phone. No lag noticed in 4 days of use.  Sometimes heats up a little.. but it's negligible heating.

Battery, camera, superamoled display are main features the phone is offering, for me its sar value and its weight management add to it. It has its own limitation in night camera and heavy gaming, i dont mind them as its offering way more than many others in this price range.Fully satisfied with this product and also has to appreciate fast delivery from amazon team.

I charge it 95% by 9am and the battery last till next day 11am. I wanted something like this before. * camera quality I'd again plus point in this phone.. 64mp output is awesome.In short, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome phone.. From my side I give 10/10.

Nice Experience

  Nice experience in using the phone. Fingerprint reader is quite fast and precise. The battery life(6000mah), I expected it to be quite high but it lasts one day or slightly more and it takes at least 4 hours to fully charge and when not fully charge it discharges faster. Camera is nice.I wrote so much about battery because it is branded as quite high and I expected more. Overall the experience using this phone is quite nice and I recommend to buy this phone.

  On screen fingerprint sensor is better! At this price rage Camera quality is awesome! You can't ask for more. Battery life is wow!

A balanced cell phone.

  Value for money product by Samsung. Battery life is good, so is camera and screen quality. Although the macro camera isn't that good, also super slow mo and slow mo videos lack in quality when taken indoors, but allover it's a good and balanced set. However, I might suggest that if you're interested in purchasing this set go for the 'Ocean Blue' back colour as the black one looks very tacky and I feel that Samsung should've provided glass back at this price...

  Overall Samsung M 31 is value for money. It is matching my expectations. The performance is quite good, look is excellent. The best thing is its battery life.

Yes I want to mention one thing that I used to do average 2 hr video call and more average 3 hr internet surfing or youtube video streaming apart from regular call. So I am satisfied with its battery performance also. As I need to put it on charge at night only. And battery will never drain out whole day, if it is fully charged.

So cant review about processer.However the only one issue i noticed is the mobile data/ wifi may become unresponsive/ idle. We will have to turn off wifi/ toggle flight mode to solve it.

  Samsung Galaxy M31 mobile is good in all respects, but it also has some bad aspects.  Battery is 60000 mAh but output is 5800mAh.  But that's not the bad side.  The worst part of it is its power adapter ;  15w adapter for 6000mAh battery is not a fast adapter at all.  It takes three to three and a half hours to be fully charged.  Also, if you change some settings, its camera works very well.

  Battery,  amoled display and performance is really good. The phone is really smooth & there are many feature which make this phone premium. I'm disappointed with camera because after taking shot when you zoom the picture , picture will not look clear also in night when you capture video or photo there are too much noise in image which disappoint me. But I'm not using camera too much so I keep this phone because of powerful battery and amoled display.

  Ordered a 128 GB Ocean Blue Samsung Galaxy M31. Though I had to wait for few extra days than expected but believe me the phone is a real MegaMonster- in terms of Features and Quality per se. And the price at which Samsung has put it forward in the market is just unbelievable. Please go for it if you’re looking for something in range of 15k-20k. It’s comparable or in fact is beating few products in the market which are in between 25k -50k.

  Been using this for a week. If you are looking for the brand name Samsung and you need a phone under 20k, this is a good option. Display is awesome with super amoled screen. If you are a heavy gamer, this is not meant for you. But if you have a habit of watching movies while on long journey, this is awesome for you. Battery is a monster but the only drawback is that the charger is only 15 W . It could have been at least 18 W. Overall, really satisfied.

  It took 2 days and 3 visits to a service center which is located 10 km from my place to submit the phone for repair in Navi Mumbai, Kharghar. The service center is giving only 25 tockens per day and accepting only 25 phones for repair each day. Even after booking a online appointment they have not accepted the phone saying for online appointment the timing is different. Such a pathetic service by Samsung.

  Best value for money in this mid range segment..1. Plus point is Super Amoled display with the vibrant and eye-catching colors...For display can't beat any other brands.2. 64mp quad camera's quality is truly awesome.. it captures very nice photos.3. Mega monster 6000 Battery is one more plus point, although weight distribution is great...It will give you near about 2 days long battery backup.4. Fingerprint sensor is also fast.Overall it is super mega monster & king of all brands

  Although the battery capacity is 6000 mah , it exhaust till 80% from 7 am to 10 pm. No fast charging. It takes more than two hours to charge from 20vto 100 % with charger provided with set.Cameras are good. But difficult to get clear focus with zoom or micro.Unable to demonstrate the advantage of micro.But overall it's good.

  It's perfectly packed with 6000 mah battery, 64 mega pixel camera and 6 gigs of ram with 128 gigs of storage at such a low prize.I'm now able to beat my friends in PUBG, who earlier used to mock me when my last phone was unable to make to the match.Switching from PUBG to Insta is this much quick that I can reply to my girl instantly and again resume the match.  ; )All it sucks that I'm unable to show it to my friends due to Covid.

  Screen is awesome.. charger is of 15 watt only.. gives a warranty of 1 year.. screen guard or back cover ain't free.. there are Many inbuilt apps .. blue color suits awesome with the sleek design.. phone runs for a day or more.. 2nd sikal slot is not hybrid, so u can add an sd card along with it along with 2 nano sim cards. Android 10 is awesome. 6 GB RAM with such a processor makes it good gaming too (not awesome though). Camera is average. Plus its samsung, so u can have a trust.

  Overall phone is very good battery backup super, but camera quality is not good with 64megapixel pictures like 25megapixel and front camera 32mp working like 13mp. I m not satisfied with camera quality. Because I purchased this see 64mp and 32mp here Samsung can improve. I purchased this phone last month on 6th July 2020 phone is overall working good. If anybody need good battery backup with good looking I suggest this phone

  Samsung Galaxy M31 - Batterry life is awesome.. its a jumbo battery. but the fast charger takes 2.5 hrs to charge completely, which is bit high in comparison with other fast charges.The camera quality is awesome with different featuresperformance is good, but observed an issue i.e sometime the UI hangs and did not respond. At that time it was very difficult to reboot, access the mobile.

  The battery life is the biggest lifesaver for me. Even with heavy usage, it lasts me for almost 2 days which is beyond impressive. Unless you are gaming for like 2 hours straight with the highest settings, you won't face any heating issues. The camera has awesome performance but low light photos could be better. I wanted a faster charger but this is the most value for money phone that I have ever seen. Also, the new Samsung M31s is a great option.

  The phone is great. Decent battery life, excellent camera, sleek UI. If you're looking for a budget phone, you cannot go wrong with this.One hitch though is the sound quality. Specifically, the volume. No matter what I'm listening to, unless I'm using earpieces the volume has to be pushed to max in order to hear anything. This is not something I was expecting tbh.

Super Amoled Display, Quad Camera setup with 64mp primary camera at 15k price range will not disappoint you literally it's camera is awesome and yes 6000mah battery despite having such a monster battery the phone feels very light and handy due the the plastic material used at the back which makes it less attractive than other glass back panel.

Most of the time I read online so this device is good for me.Happy with Samsung. Happy with amazon for its delivery process

  I got around  2 days battery life in single charge  but It takes much time for charging  6000 mah battery  approximately 2 and half  hour. My small suggestion  is  Samsung should have provided 25 watt charger instead of 15 watt. Camera clarity of the phone  is good as compared to other phones in this price range and the processor too. The fingerprint sensor and face recognition  is much faster and we can unlock the  phone  within 1 or 2 seconds.

  As a gift to my mother, she wanted a bigger screen and a good keyboard for the phone. The phone not only serves the purpose, it has an amazing battery life which lasts for 2 days and one of the best camera quality in this range of phones, having 4 cameras.The camera automatically scanned documents itself, so there's no need of scanning applications.It's a great value for money product of a reliable  brand.

Good battery life
",5,"

  Samsung Galaxy M31 has a good built, screen has a U-shape notch and is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. It includes an AMOLED infinity-U display which have good impact on battery life as well as in revealing true black and improved color correction. Its camera is good for HDR shots and wide range camera shots but macro shots are just average because of Jot much clarity. It is good for gaming as it provides high graphics and high frame rate.

  Liked: As if now once charged we can use the phone one whole day without charging, features are good.Dislike: 1. SD card and Sim slot case is sensitive.2.Other game apps are preinstalled which are unnecessary it occupies space, off-course you can uninstall, my advice is that uninstall the apps which you are not in need.Overall good product, value for money.

",5,"

  If you want a Daily driver, then go for it, I totally like it, yeah there are higher refresh rate phones out there but the amoled display more than makes up for it. The camera is also top notch for the price, the only caveat is that you will have to play games on high settings not on very high, and for a casual player that's more than enough. The body i not as premium as the competition but if you like practicality then it's okay for you.

  This smartphone has maximum features all available  in very reasonable  rate and that too under one of the most reliable  brand i.e. Samsung, obviously  preferable over other competitors with cheap quality.Battery backup is excellent, so is camera quality, processing speed etc. User interface is also convenient, very handy.Better to choose this mobile even if budget is around 25k.

  Great battery backup and processing speed. Video and audio both play good and speaker is better then other phone in same segment . Phone is handy and edge screen gives it a good look.

Overall a good buy and value for money.

  Samsung Galaxy m31 is good smartphone with original camera quality,with powerfull battery and finger print is good enough.But one thing it is lacking is the processor is old version.It should be changed and provided with good processor to compete Mi ,oppo and realme phones at this price.I would recommend to install qualcomm snapdragon (nearly 700 )processor.It will help in fast unlocking by using face camera because it slow little bit.

  Battery life is really excellent. I uses internet whole day on my mobile and it lasts for 36 hours which I must say it's amazing. I was using iphone earlier and I used to battery re charge in approx. 14hours. Camera quality is not as good as of iphone but considering the mobile price I am happy with the camera too. Fingerprint reader is good. Only demerit is its bit bulky in weight and is not light weight as iphone.

Also the only problem I'm facing is that fingerprint reader doesn't read properly. The phone is lightweight for 6000 mh battery.

  Although the pictures came out well with the camera, during the pandemic I was required to click pictures of my assignments and notes, and I noticed the mid section of the pictures were crystal clear but the outer part would be blurred. Although you can only notice this difference on a bigger screen like your PC for example.Overall the phone is just amazing.Battery life , screen quality and fingerprint sensors are beyond great.

Best mobile under 25k
",5,"

  M31 works perfectly smooth on high performance games. Its display is far better than any other mobile in this range. Its 64MP front camera with 5MP depth sensor allows us to take ultra hd pics but it struggles to auto focus.I does not have front flash which makes difficult to take selfies in dark.It has 6000mah battery which runs for approx 1.5 days on one charge.Overall I would say this is currently best phone to buy under 25k.

  Liked the performance as per the 6 GB RAM.Fingerprint sensor sometimes doesnt detect properly so need to switch to other finger.Camera quality is awesome including all the modes especially wide angle.Battery works whole day with high usage which includes high brightness, WiFi.All at last picture Quality is more than awesome which satisfies you when you watch netflix.

Best alternate for a chinese brand
",5,"

  Firstly i hesitate for buying a samsung mobile, but seriously guys if you are looking for a chinese alternate then samsung M series will be your good buy.Camera is awsome, display is above class, performance is good or even better for a general use.Very important gaming (Pubg) is good smooth extreme 40 50 fps.. yup if you are a hard core gamer then it will disappoint you other wise it's very good.

  Fingerprint sensor is very fast ,battery does not feel like 6000mah ,camera quality is ok nothing out of the blue( in  this price its best),there is some lag which need to optimised,display quality while even shy some highend phones,build in quality feels good..When i got my phone deliver ,it was covered in dirt from inside something shocking apart from this there was no screen protection film on it which was another shock.

  This is my review after using the phone for last three days. This phone got an excellent quality of camera and a monster 6000 MaH battery which works for one and half days per charge and honestly it's not an game centric mobile but it's not that you can't play game in this mobile you can play game like PubG in medium high graphics which works really well and smoothly.Overall my verdict is 5/5.

  Slow processor, sometimes does not read both sim simultaneously.In same price you would get a better Chinese product but if you are a samsung lover you can go for it but you might be slightly disappointed with the processor performance.Instead samsung would have given a Snapdragon processor it might be a better choice.If you hate Chinese phones and China surely go for it.

  This is the first time im using a Samsung phone, and would say the phone is excellent. I Didnt find any sort of problem using it since past two weeks. Battery is so good as it last upto a day easily if you are a heavy user and the screen quality is also awsome. I doesnt know if this one has the best processor but i didnt find any lag or other problems. One can definitly go for this except if you are looking for best gaming phone.

  This is the best phone that you can ever ask for if your budget is under 16k. sAMOLED display, 6000 mah battery, 64 MP rear cam, 32MP front cam and the 6gb ram - 128gb rom combo are the deal breakers. Go for it blindly. I have used phones of redmi(xiaomi) & realme previously. I can definitely vouch for the Samsung brand for all the above mentioned features. Thank you Samsung for such a marvel.

Its a good midranged samsung device.

  Speaking of performance, launching apps and switching between them is quick with no noticeable lag anywhere during the course of the review. The user interface is responsive and gaming performance is excellent.The 64MP lens is an upgrade over a 48MP lens seen on the Galaxy M30s. With a fast aperture of f/1.8, the main lens can take excellent shots in any condition. This works great in low-light conditions, too.

Good for a budget phone, but could be better
",1,"

  The battery life honestly leaves something to be desired, but it's pretty good for a budget phone. Also, the camera isnt all one would expect from a 64 MP camera, and since samsung doesn't allow changing the shutter speed on its mid range phones, the camera could honestly be better. But the overall performance of the phone isnt all bad. However, I have had some issues with specific apps and the built in keyboard getting frozen.

  M31 is good for an average user. I'm a regular user & I'm happy about the product. Don't compare this with Redmi or Poco phones since those are good at performance but this lags a bit & you could feel those lags.But the main reason I took this was of Samsung's one UI. The UI is much better than other OEMs.Overall the phone is good.And of course the cameras are good too.

A perfect mid-range phone with good internal features with high capacity battery.
",5,"

  The phone is working nicely as its around two months since I am using, the most significant advantage is high capacity battery, and the power mode is a cool feature. The camera is nice, even good who wants to scan documents on a regular basis as a scanner is by default. Though Volume of the speaker is not up to the mark but the Dolby atoms supported by Bluetooth speaker or earphone/headphone makes the experience better.

GALAXY-Mega Monster (31)

  I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy J7 prime and the phone worked fine. I decided to opt for an M-series phone with that expectation in mind. In my opinion ,this phone is specifically designed keeping the Indian market in mind . Features like the 6000mah battery and sAmoled display justify the cost to an extent but Samsung still provides an under-rated processor.

  Overall performance of Samsung M31 is good. But really unhappy with the camera quality. Picture quality does not match with 64 MP camera, even resolution is also very poor. In Macro mode, there is no any option for auto focus. Totally unsatisfied camera performance. May be Samsung will update and improve it's camera software for M31 later on.

Battery life is good .I am using 2 sim and it drains when I reach home  .full day battery life after using 2 sim. The size needs to reduce the weight is ok since the battery is 6000mah.

  Very happy with my M31 - my first Samsung smartphone. Having migrated from stock android - Samsung One UI doesn't feel bloated or slow.

Great Mobile in less money....

  Great! It is one the best mobiles I have ever used. Though sometimes touch never works and in a few attempts screen gets lock for a while, but it is ignorable as it happens due to moisture. Camera clarity is great. I have attached an image that was clicked in a little dark. Voice and Audio clarity is great too. It didn't hang even once during any app usage.I recommend it over other phones.

  The fingerprint sensor is perfect.  The battery life is 24 hours all along . If use data than just a little less. The camera quality is just awesome. The Ar doodle is mesmerizing.  The 64mp camera just clicks the best portraits. The back of the phone is just smooth and gets scratched easily .  But you can always use a case That's the drawback or else it's good!

  Overall M31 is good and I am happy with its ram, space and performance management, one of the features includes moving the external applications apk file to SD Card to improve more internal space, however 6000 mah battery is disappointing it doesn't work like real 6000 but more like 4000mah, other than this everything is good at this price, good display and camera quality is what samsung is known for all the time.

  Where is 64MP camera and 6000 Mh battery?. After iPhone Samsung was the only brand on which we used to trust.

You should definitely the m31
",4,"

  Theres no way you wouldnt want to buy this phone. Lets talk about it in pros and cons. Pros- its massive 6000 mah battery packed along with a super amoled screen and a camera with a superior quality in its price range would definitely blow your experience to a whole other level. The only con I felt along with this device is that other companies provide at least a earphone or a mobile cover along with the handset. However this is not the case with m31 thats very sad

Happy experience buying it.

  I bought this phone like a month or 2 ago. Previously i had used Samsung phones so I had expected a high performing phone when it came toM31 and to be honest it totally stood upto my expectations.The camera is amazzzing and the blurr effect just adds to it. The fingerprint sensor is accurate enough to maintain the security. Due to 6GB RAM the phone works quite smoothly. So,overall I will rate this phone a 4.9/5.

A better phone in 15K-17K RANGE

  1. Average  64 MP REAR and 32 MP selfie camera2. Depth and ultra wide camera a bit more helpful to click a good picture.3. Resolution of 2340 X 1080 + 16 m color support  give us a nice video experience.4. 6000 MAH Battery take almost 3 hours to get full charge but work only 1 or 1.25 daysComparatively a better phone with this price range

  Has to say this is bang for buck. Be it Battery or Display or Performance this came out a satisfactory product from samsung. The only lacking thing in this product is Camera . For this price you expect a bit more performance from camera . Overall a fine device that can get the job done without any hiccups. Also new One UI is pretty good as it improves ease to operation.

  I wish that galaxy m31 had a better processor.I would have given 5 stars if it had a sony sensor.The 64 MP camera photo doesn't look that much better compared to a 48 MP camera.Chose this smartphone only if you use your phone for entertainment purposes like watching videos and movies ,capturing photos except gaming which can be done on a moderate level.

  To be honest it's the best mobile to purchase on this range. It's not a gaming mobile.  But when it comes to daily  basic needs you can go for it and you will love it. Camera is great. Overall performance is good. You can play PUBG with HDR mode for 1hr smoothly .It's a package of entertainment. Display is amazing.Upgraded processor would be the best job. Knox security and Samsung pay is not available.

No earphones

  Overall the phone is excellent. But one thing disappointed me that Samsung does not provide earphones which is necessary for smartphones. I have used other companies' phones and have always got earphones even if the price was lower than Samsung's. If you buy a Samsung Phone under rupees 20000 it simply doesn't provide earphones. Hence I gave it 4 stars.

  Why did you use cheap quality back side of the smartphones at this range. After 1 month it gets scratches and dust spots everywhere which seems impossible to remove. Even after backcover is there , the dust particles and scratches are damaging it's shine. I think it will  lower the newness of my smartphone. Truly sad by this. Another factor is that 15 watt charger which takes more time than it is mentioned i.e. 160 minutes.

Overall a nice phone to buy at this price range with a samsung tag.

  This device is a charm to use.  The One UI is fluid and display...OMG : The Best.Everything is just perfect in this phone. The Widevine support with Dolby Atmos is heaven for binge watchers. Games's experience is also good.The Battery usually lasts 2 days after normal usage.The Camera is exceptionally well according to its price.I just love Samsung.

The Best phone at this Price Range

  The Battery life is awesome. I use the phone all day and can't see the full charged phone below 50 percent. The 64 megapixels camera is mind blowing, I never regret buying this phone. I suggest this to everyone. Don't buy the Chinese phones with those fake camera features and stuff, This phone is perfect. It is truly made in India and made for India, Really impressed by Samsung.

  Review after a month of purchase:Probably the best Non-Chinese product at this price. The display is upto the mark. The back camera is good, the front camera, however, could have been better. The battery charges quickly and stays for a long time inspite of a heavy useage. No heating like MI phones. Should definitely go for this if you want a good, durable phone in this range.

  Finally a budget phone which is truly a flagship killer. A blind choice for specially those who extensively use their phone all day long till late night. 6000 mAh says it all!! Macro lens is a very good add to the phone and like always Samsung is very good with its display but to providing it to a budget phone is also an added benifit.The best part about this phone is even though it has such a big battery spec it feels light and good to hold.

  If u r going for samsung this phone is best at this price range. Slight problem in charging as it takes large charging time as only 15W high speed charging is supported and it takes near about 2 and a half hour to fully charge. but it is compensated by the battery life, nearly 2 days at moderate usage. Camera quality is not the best but average.

GOOD PRODUCT

  Afterall this guy is a battery beast.. And this is not chinese too..The best part is battery for sure. And the crisp amoled display is superb. Speakers ensure good quality. I have found not much problems for pubg. Night mode cameras are dull. Face unlock sensor requires a  good light. The look of the mobipe is not that deluxe one. But this surely has the value for money🙏

  Pretty decent buy if you are looking for a budget phone with some good specifications. The camera and battery re really good. The customized android by Samsung has allows toggling a wide range of features. Speakers are average could have been better. The best part is the AMOLED display. It's so much fun watching movies/series on this display.

  Processor is really good for day to day tasks and light to medium gaming. Fingerprint reader is fast, so is face recognition. Camera quality is very good in daylight. The real champion here is the massive 6000 mAh battery.  It is an absolute lifesaver during power shutdowns and travels. Definitely recommend the product. Go for it without second thoughts if you are not a heavy gamer.

Bad packing by Samsung
",5,"

  The mobile phone was not packed properly by Samsung. The phone was rapped in transparent poly cover. The cover was not placed correctly. It had two cut for volume and on off button. However the poly cover was placed incorrectly. Due to that the on off button was stuck in the phone. After removing the transparent poly cover it started working.

Samsung m31 a good deal. What a monster!
",4,"

  The phone is good so far. Its a value for money at this price I must say. The phone is light weighted considering the battery size of 6000 MAH and the display is good. You get a SAMOLED full hd+ display and its very good. I will if you want a budget smart phone with a decent camera and features go for a Samsung m31 or a m21. You get the trusted brand value of Samsung as well.

  A very nice product from samsung at mid-range. Camera is good in daytime. Battery (if you're not into very heavy gaming) can easily last for 1-2 days. Smooth functioning owing to RAM.

  This samsung mobile is one of my best mobile beacuse of its camera and life-long battery. It gives update very fast which makes this mobile standing in a recent times. Wide angle camera helps to take a photos in a wedding season in a single frame with many friends. Fast charging mode is great as you don't need to wait for a long time. I am glad to invest money on such a great phone.

Way better than redmi note 9 pro max

  No issues in gaming, or heavy multi-tasking. Camera quality is good. Battery life is bomb. UI is waaaay better and waaay less irritating than Redmi note 9 pro max, which also I own right now.Realised later that UI does make a significant difference.

  M31 is having very good camera and pitcure quality & good battery long for almost 1and half day with a resonable price. Fingre print reader is not up to mark but if you want good battery life then you should go for M31. Very important thing is not having heating problem and hanging problem while gaming.

  Samsung M31 comes with a smooth touch mega amoled screen which gives a very nice user experience. The camera quality of 64MP is really up to the mark.

  The Camera Quality is quite good. However  would have liked Pro mode to be better with more manual controls. Fingerprint reader is slower compared to my old mobile but doesn't disappoint in any way. Battery life is enough for a day's use with moderate activity. Given the  battery size, better battery life expected. The mobile is a bit heavier and somewhat lags in performance but makes up for it in the features provided.

  This device used to provide a battery backup for 2 days initially and in less than a week it has come down to 1 day. Rear Camera seems to be alright the front one is poor.

  The phone is quite good. Its Fast as it have a 6 GB Ram. It have an Amazing Battery life of 6000 mAh which last for  a full day without charging while playing games and doing stuffs. It has a good camera 64 MP and a good video recording at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30fps. The bad thing in this mobile is that it don’t not come with an earphones while having an earphone jack. That very disappointing. Overall it is a MegaMoster.

  I bought the phone for its battery life, but sadly it doesn't meet my expectations. My old phone with similar battery capacity lasted longer than this. The quick charger is a scam. It takes hours to charge my phone. And the phone heats up so fast during calls. It's frustrating. I wouldn't recommend it as a great phone to invest on.

I used to believe that Samsung's midrange mobiles are waste of money until i got this
",5,"

  I got my hand on this mobile two months back and have been using this ever since.Camera is too good(far better than my old mobile i.e.,Redmi note 5 pro) i am impressed with its dimlight pictures. battery life is excellent as expected ,only disadvantage with this mobile is it is heavy to handle(probably due to its massive 6000 mAh battery) and there's no other con stopping you from buying this one

All good except battery life, fast charging mode and some unexpected heating.

  My overall opinion is that this is a good phone except for its battery life.The actual battery life is very poor from what was shown in ads. And I am not at all experiencing fast charging mode rest all ok.I *also notice some heating problems* temperature of phone increase sometimes unexpectedly (like when we watch youtube videos, doing whatsapp etc).

  The mobile phone is definitely good. Battery life is more then 24 hours with good usage. A silicon cover inside the box would have been really nice, I guess that and earphones are the only thing are missing in the phone. Rest is amazing.

  The one thing that samsung have that non other has is quality. I'm happy with the phone. The fingerprint quality is far better than its competitor models which I personally feel. Battery is a huge asset to this model and deserves much kudos to its performance.

  I am writing this review after about 3 months of use. I will say that the phone is the best bargain on can have in this budget. Battery life is super however when temperature of room increase beyond 40 battery doesn't charge fully. Camera quality is excellent except night mode. Taking screenshot by swiping hand is bit complicated for me.

Good Phone ... Bought 2
",1,"

  With 6 Gb Ram 128 GB memory, dual SIM & a dedicated card slot, 6000 MAh battery and a decent camera ... What more could you ask for in 16000/- ... Bought 2 for my wife and self and upgraded from Samsung A9 Pro which had outlived its life ... ""Itne mein bachhe ki jaan lo ge kya"" ... Good phone ... Took me all about 1.5 hours to shift to this phone with Smart Switch ... And made in India too ...

  Top class battery life and good camera. Fingerprint sensor doesn't work for me since I'm a senior citizen. An even faster charger than 15w would help.

Overall good phone
",5,"

  I bought this phone 1 month ago. As of now, it's performance is very good. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Camera quality is also very good. But the main attraction is it's 6000mAh battery. I have to charge it once in 2 days only. I'm not much into gaming. So, I can't tell about that. But if you are a normal user, then I would definitely suggest you to go for this one.

  Samsung m31 is an amazing phone. It really has monster and long lasting battery life. Fingerprint sensor is also good and fast. Cameras are really good. I really loved ultra wide angle and all the other features. Phone has cool display and features. For watching movies its best. For gaming also it is really good. If someone want to buy a new phone it is must buy phone.

  Over all price range is good...Phone is not v good. I think good. for multitasking, watching movies, videos. Lower games. but i expected moreNot a premiums type phn  plastic design not glossy finish you have a better options like poco, realme, and also m31s..Will update the review after using the phone for 1 weeks.

Love it..

  I purchased this item on 7th March. I would say overall it's a great phone according to me in this price range. If you are a core gamer and want a gaming phone then don't go for it, but I play Pubg in this phone its quiet good graphics. In day light camera quality is too good, but in low light it's not up to the mark. Display & battery of this phone is great. You can go for it.

  I feel that the in-call voice sound is very feeble. The device works smoothly and the screen is Brilliant! I am not a camera person but I feel it is decent snd good.

  I have liked all the specs of the m31 mainly because this phone has a wide range of advanced features for a very low price .

  Good experience so far. I moved from using a mid range moto, so the camera quality is a huge improvement! On the flip side the sudden increase in the number of unnecessary ""Samsung"" apps is unnerving. Had to deactivate them all. Otherwise the phone speed is good, display and camera are wonderful. Battery charges pretty quickly with the in the box charger too.

  The Galaxy M31 further refines the experience. The build is now sturdier, the primary camera has been improved, and Samsung has stacked a bigger RAM. Other than these enhancements, AMOLED display, OneUI, and massive battery advantages are still there. The Galaxy M31s is not for hardcore gaming, but it manages to deliver a distinguished Samsung experience in its class.

  The camera quality is very good. There is only one  thing I didnt like.

  M31 is better from its predecessor M30 with bigger battery life and camera quality. Finger print reader is much faster. Snappy colors which come beautifully on screen.  Not much heavy and looks are stylish.

  Very good product, value for money, camera quality excellent. Battery backup outstanding. Both fingerprint sensor and face unlock works fast and smooth. Display is absolutely fantastic. Touch and screen refresh is also good. Only problem I have is that it takes forever to charge! For 6000mah battery, a charger with more output was needed. Overall, it was a nice buy

Samsung M31 , Not user friendly
",5,"

  Phone is not so good as in advertisement. Every time we have to check screen for any new message,mail etc. I was already use MI Note4, which blinks one indicator with different color for message,mail and WhatsApp message and also during charging with yellow color. Only back up is sufficient for one day working. During video play, there should zoom option.

Absolutely worth it just face unlocking is slow
",1,"

  Wonderful cellphone worth premium looks and obviously monstrous  battery life, camera quality is good but face unlocking is a bit slow infact not working properly. Cons I found in this cell phone is that some times it stops working (hanging problem like each and every Samsung cell phone) and face unlocking is very slow but overall a good phone in  this range. I suggest to go for it as overall its worth it

Game changer product! - outstanding performance of battery, display and camera
",5,"

  I was a one plus user prior to this product. But this device is game changer. I used it rigorously for a day still more than 40% charge was remaining. In idle condition battery lasts almost 3 days. Camera is quickly adjustable to near and far objects. Face recognition is impressive but finger reader seems little sloppy.

  Delivery -on timeSamsung M31 is nice phone with a great camera. Selfie camera lack a little bit crispnessLoved the wide angle lens photography.

  The phone is fabulous just what you need. It easily lasts more than a day on minimal settings. I am not into games but it runs high spec games decently as wellI am giving 4.5 star only because the ultra wide angle camera is a bit shaby. It needs software update.Apart from that phone is awesome. No problems occured

  Good in Camera,  Fingerprint , display & battery life. Especially camera is very good. You might not need a DSLR if you have M31 in ur hand.Not sure if fast charging is enabled. It takes nearly 4hrs to reach 100%. May be it is because of 6000mah..Mobile handling should be carefully as the outfit is very smooth and slips from hand very easily

  Fingerprint gives quick response and battery can also sustain for a full day or more and these two are above expectations however when camera is concerned M series lack some important features of pro mode which otherwise are available in the phones of other companies having similar or lower price range.

  The phone is perfect in all aspects except the Fingerprints sensor. If your fingers have a little moisture as well then it won't recognize the fingerprint and you have to unlock with the alternate method.

  The fingerprint reader is effectively faster than the previous M-Series phone launched by Samsung. The camera quality, I would say is far better than what I had expected it to be.

  Good phone I liked it after using for 7 days now.Battery life is good.Screen size and clarity is good.I am somehow not convinced about safety features and not going to use it for my banking use.Screen is not fully use as display it seems, some part of screen at bottom is not at all used for display which looks but odd.

  The finger-print is swift and unlocks the phone in a blink of an eye. The Camera is fabulous. The wide angle camera includes alot in just a frame.

The battery life is very good and drags the power to last upto 2-2.5 days.

  Grt battery. Superb camera. Also, samsung adds a lot of other features to it like the ultra data saver, battery saver can help run it for 3days on a go.

The Camera was Extraordinary but has lot of Noise in image at Low light area. But the Battery does Not satisfied me, It not work like 6000 MAh but now very bad. Finaly it was Totally Worth for 15/16 K.

A gorgeous display and a beast of a battery

  Best screen in this price segment. A decent camera and a very good battery life lured me to buy this phone.This is NOT a gaming phone as other brands offer better processors in this price range. But for all the MOVIE fans and casual users this is a very good choice. Also it has one UI which I think has come a long way since samsung's touchwiz UI.

  The Galaxy M31 uses the same processor as the Galaxy M30s: Exynos 9611. This might not be the fastest processor around, but I got fairly decent performance with 6GB RAM and 128GB expandable storage inside. In fact, the performance is slightly better, thanks to Android 10.Thank u

  Amazing phone overall. Battery lasts for an entire day with heavy usage. It only needs to be charged once in a day for heavy usage or once in 2 days for average usage. The cameras are way better than expected. The display is vibrant. Great pricing too. I found it to be the best among all phones of this range and even ones that are slightly more expensive.

  That model is quite good in this range launched by samsung. It looks good and battery life of that phone is impressive. But the camera quality is not so much good as a 64 MP camera quality.

Great Product, a power bank in itself with 6000mAh battery life.
",5,"

  It's been 3 to 4 months since I have bought this smartphone. Unlike myth it didn't hang. It is truly a monster in terms of battery life of 6000mAh. It has got 4 cameras with main camera sporting 64MP lens for wide-angle and then 5MP lens for depth, a 5MP macro lens and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens. The ocean blue color really stands out. Worth buying.

Ok Mobile not the perfect like A series .
",4,"

  It is a OK types Mobile, heavy due to 6000 mah battery . Battery life is around one and half day .  Do not compare this phone with any A series phone A series far better.Samsung should have included NCF feature in this phone . Sometime it automatically get swith off.Who looking for budget phone with Android 10  this phone can be a choice .

  Security like app lock is absent which is a necessary requirement today.One can easily see yr msgs details in notification panel bcoz in setting ,very less option available  ,Actually i bought it based on what the product was conveying though its advertising but  my requirement was less as i mentioned above,and not fulfilled.In rest of matters  phone is very good.

Very Low media valume.
",5,"

  1. The media valume is very load, even on loud speaker and head set we need to maintain minimum 70% valume level to enjoy the music. It is very low to music and youtube videos.2. Coming to camera no data and time print on camera photos, only Galaxy watermart prints but no data and time watermark feature to camare. It is very big draw back.

  Fingerprint reader is not that quick, and face unlock too sometimes it doesn't recognize my face... And for the 60000 Mah battery it only work for 24hrs you will have to charge it every single night even on minimal use (except gaming). But yes camera Quality is very good w/t any doubt..But it's not a gaming phone.

Not camera centric and over all performance will not extraordinary but will satisfy
",5,"

  Image is always saturated and it is personal taste. But compared to other phones like Poco X2 and Motorola one fusion plus, the images are over saturated and low light images are noise. Further Exynos chip in this phone has some how lower speed compared to SD and MT chips of same range. Ram management has to be improved.

  Fingerprint works accurately but sometimes there is lagging while using it,however the battery life is awesome with heavy usage whole day & if you only use social media only in your phone then it can run upto 2 days easily  & the camera quality is good enough but the issue is that the colours doesn't seems to be realistic or natural.

  Camera quality is good but poor at low light and too much of photo compression takes place every time and results less detailing and sharpness .Fingerprint reader is one of the best sensor in this device and very fast and accurate.Battery life holds nearly around 20-24hrs for a normal usage and with 4G data and gaming usage gives a standby around 12 hrs .

  Two things I didn't like :1. Design of fingerprint reader is not good compared to other phones. Its elliptical in shape and not circular due to which it doesn't cover the whole finger tip area from all angles and one would end up trying many times to unlock the phone.2. Screen heats up a little sometimes while on call.

Amazing battery life and Camera
",5,"

  The phone is very user intuitive and easy to use. The core features such as long lasting battery and quad camera are on the spot. From the day of purchase without heavy usage of my phone the battery lasted for almost 3 days. The phone is not too heavy for its size because of its plastic body. All in all the phone is packed with goodness for the price its marked for .

Plus it has a very long and smooth battery life. If you have normal usage then you will rarely need to charge your phone once in every 24 hours.

  The best phone I have had so far.The finger print sensor is  excellent and very  sensitive. The camera quality is very good and  the best part is the battery life which I have to charge once in two days for which I am very much thankful  to Samsung Galaxy 31.The screen color and the sensitiveness is excellent. The best phone in the price range

  M31 is best in range if you compare that Xiaomi and Vivo..I have given my research and figured it out that this phone gives me best battery back up and has all the necessary features which I required. It comes with wifi calling which is the best part given the situation with service provider signals..My recommendation is ""Go for it""

  The fingerprint senson works a little bit slpw but everything else about Samsung Galaxy M31 is awesome . Itt's battery life is amzing and one thing I love about this phone is it's camera quality . The camera quality is way above the price range of this phone  . And the processor(exynos 9611) is also appreciable.

  Samsung, i think this is the one of the brand in India who never compromise in quality.

  Great battery backup runs 2-days on average usage.  Camera quality is good but not up to the marks.I think Samsung is also going only for the pixel war, not for the quality.

The best phone in its price range
",5,"

  One of the best things about this phone is its battery life. It took phone 2 days of rigorous use to get to a battery level of 35%. The other thing is its camera. It is excellent if you always want to take pictures and not carry a camera around. It is a phone worth much higher and available at such an affordable price.

  My first mobile with 128GB space and 6GB RAM. Mobile with this space and RAM for reasonable price is the reason why I went for it. I like the colour and the display is full size screen. Camera is awesome. I browsed and compared many mobile models and website and chose Samsung M31.Happy for choosing this.

  The phone is good and does all the job that a smart phone should do. The camera is above average and the battery doesnt charge fast. It takes 4 hours to charge from 0-100. But the battery does last long which is expected from the higher battery capacity. Stays up for 1.5 days with full charge

  This phone looks great on hand. The battery pretty much good. Long lasting. I haven't  seen any lagging in the phone. Coming to camera, it would suggest  you good shot and details and brightness. I loved capture in dark giving you 80% details.When it comes  to display, no matter, no comparison it is the king.

  Samsung Galaxy M31 is very good mobile under this cost by samsung.The phone display is awesome and nice UI but one disappointing thing is it lacks some speed.This phone is light in weight and very compact to use.It feels great to use than other phones.The battery is too big and sustained very long but i think samsung could give more fast charging.

  It says it has gorilla glass 3 , but it's a lie . It can't survive the slightest fall . The screen is super weak and fragile  , camera is not that good as well . 64 mp camera is a mislead . Also it hangs sometimes

  The 60Hz AMOLED display is amazing. The battery life could not be better. The one UI by Samsung works very well on Top of Android 10. Only suggestion to Samsung would be to include a generic bumper case in the box as the plastic back is a fingerprint magnet. Perfectly justifies the reasonable price range.

Over all phone is good but the quality may be improved by proving few remaing good features..
",5,"

  Back camera quality is a bit lower as expected by 64 mp camera. Zooming 8X causes blured images. Also mobile is draining 6000 mh battery within 1.5 days in case of not using much. One more the back cove coule be given in much better quality like other brand mobile phoned e.g. gorilla glass like things..

  One of the best phones under Rs.20000. Excellent battery and camera quality. You will love the camera quality detailing. Watching on super amoled is mesmerizing.  Only drawback is plastic back and slow charging.  Otherwise go blindly for it if you are a non Chinese phone lover.

  Absolutely love the feel of this lightweight phone. The camera is amazing. Haven'thad a chance till now to explore it properly due to lockdown. Camera can be the main reason why you can choose M31 over m21. A completely charged battery can be used for an entire day which I think is pretty normal.

  The phone is awesome in the mid-range price segment. No issues with performance, all the apps are running smoothly. However, little unsatisfied with picture quality produced by the camera. It doesn't offers good options in the manual mode.

DISAPPOINTED KINDA  !!
",5,"

  This phone lacks the simple security features such as app lock. And, in this phone you won't be able to adjust the shutter speed in the pro mode, which is a very big disadvantage if you shoot star trails and all. And, the battery life is not like what is should be. I think it runs like a 4000 maH one.

  It worked find for 4 months but since then it is giving trouble. It goes on switching off and on suddenly more so when I open the camera app or gallery,I lost my data due to backup. Even I gave it to Samsung service center but no use. I want you to replace my phone urgently. I do hope Amazon will do this asap.

Samsung m31 review
",5,"

  Features are fantabulous though camera options are low, but rest all is good, and it's wonderful for mid budget.Worth to buy, love using it, and even recommend it.Also 6000mAH battery is seriously too good, which is far more than other phones in this range.Also nice to run

"
Vishal Ugalmugale,"
Best device as on date, for this price.
",5,"

  Under this price cap, M31 is the best with regards to features like fingerprint sensors, battery life and even device performance is top notch. It's worth to try one and come to a conclusion of the choice you made. I concludeby saying, it's the best choice I made for myself.

  It's a must-buy if you peeking for a phone of this range. It has an impressive camera quality. Its battery life is commendable. The live focus, 64MP shot, macro shot and Quad camera are decent. The fast face Unlock and fingerprint sensor are must if you want to safeguard your data.

  Fingerprint works well but it needs lock and unlock both feature to update and in camera is good but it pixelate on full zooming it needs software update and  battery life is good 2 and half days at normal use and 1 day when you use hotspot or heavy process like gaming with other applications running.

  Very good phone with amazing battery life and amoled screen. It has really good features. Perfect phone for limited app usage. In extreme usage of apps, processor may seem a bit slow in comparison to one plus phones. Comparatively Slow processor is the only drawback but it is very minor.

The samsung galaxy m31 mobile.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you.
